Advanced gestational age, number of misoprostol doses and induction-to-abortion interval are associated with increased pain during medical abortion (Hamoda et al., 2004; Louie et al., 2017). Pain rarely starts after taking mifepristone but becomes more pronounced after misoprostol and typically peaks with expulsion (Mentula, Kalso, &amp; Heikinheimo, 2014).</p>\n<p>Medications for pain management</p>\n<p>Little evidence exists regarding the optimal pain medication regimen for medical abortion at or after 13 weeks gestation (Jackson &amp; Kapp, 2011). One randomized trial of 74 women at or after 13 weeks gestation undergoing abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol prophylactically treated patients with either an NSAID or with paracetamol plus codeine at the time of misoprostol administration. There was no difference in reported pain between the two groups, but NSAID pretreatment reduced the need for subsequent intravenous opiates (Fiala, Swahn, Stephansson, &amp; Gemzell-Danielsson, 2005). Treatment with NSAIDs did not affect abortion outcome.</p>\n<p>In the largest available cohort study, 1,002 women at or after 13 weeks gestation undergoing abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol were offered a combination of oral and parenteral narcotic analgesics and NSAIDs to manage pain (Ashok et al., 2004). Study authors reported the proportion of women who used no analgesia (18%), and those who used paracetamol plus dihydrocodone (70%), parenteral morphine (7%) or NSAIDs (5%) for pain relief; women’s pain or satisfaction with pain management was not reported. Ipas recommends a combination regimen involving prophylactic NSAIDs given at the time of misoprostol, plus oral and/or parenteral narcotic analgesics  (Edelman &amp; Mark, 2017). If the personnel, monitoring and equipment are available, regional (epidural) or patient-controlled anesthesia may be offered (Castro et al., 2003; Leoni Roberti Maggiore et al., 2016; Rosenblatt et al., 1991).</p>\n<p>Two small studies examining use of paracervical block during medical abortion at or after 13 weeks gestation found no improvement in women’s pain with this modality (Andersson, Benson, Christensson, &amp; Gemzell-Danielsson, 2016; Winkler, Wolters, Funk, &amp; Rath, 1997).</p>\n<p>Non-pharmacologic pain management</p>\n<p>There are no comparative trials evaluating the benefit of non-pharmacologic pain management strategies for medical abortion at or after 13 weeks gestation. However, experts recommend adjunctive non-pharmacologic measures to improve women’s comfort during a medical abortion, including thorough education about expected pain and bleeding, a supportive environment and application of a heating pad or hot water bottle to the lower abdomen (Akin et al., 2001). These modalities are to be employed in addition to—not as substitutes for—pain medications.</p>\n<h3>References</h3>\n<p>Akin, M. D., Weingard, K. W., Hengehold, D. A., Goodale, M. B., Hinkle, R.
