Vaginal, buccal and sublingual misoprostol are more effective than oral misoprostol (Kulier et al., 2011). Buccal dosing (Middleton et al., 2005) and sublingual dosing (Tang, Chan, Ng, Lee, &amp; Ho, 2003; von Hertzen et al., 2010) have higher rates of gastrointestinal side effects than vaginal dosing. Sublingual dosing is associated with more side effects than buccal dosing (Chai, Wong, &amp; Ho, 2013). Decreasing the sublingual misoprostol dose to 400mcg to decrease rates of side effects, however, increases the rates of incomplete abortion and ongoing pregnancy (Bracken et al., 2014; Raghavan et al., 2013; von Hertzen et al., 2010); therefore, the recommended dose of sublingual misoprostol remains 800mcg.</p>\n<p>In some settings, buccal or sublingual dosing may be preferred over vaginal dosing to accommodate women’s preferences or legal restrictions.</p>\n<p>9-10 weeks (64-70 days since LMP)</p>\n<p>A 2015 review reports data from five comparative studies including 801 women with gestations between 64-70 days and 1,163 with gestations from 57-63 days (Abbas, Chong, &amp; Raymond, 2015). In four studies, women received 200mg mifepristone followed by 800mcg buccal misoprostol (Boersma, Meyboom-de Jong, &amp; Kleiverda, 2011; Pena et al., 2014; Sanhueza Smith et al., 2015; Winikoff et al., 2012) and in one study, women received mifepristone and 400mcg sublingual misoprostol (Bracken et al., 2014). There was no difference in success rates between the two gestational groups (93.9% at 57-63 days compared to 92.3% at 64-70 days). Further, there were no differences in serious adverse events, such as hospital admissions or transfers, between the groups (0.7% and 0.5% respectively). One observational study included in the review reported an abortion success rate of 94.5% from 9-10 weeks when women used a regimen of mifepristone followed by 800mcg of vaginal misoprostol (Gouk et al., 1999). An additional study published since this review used 200mg mifepristone followed by 600mcg of sublingual misoprostol with a reported abortion success rate of 99% for the gestational age range from 9-10 weeks (Platais, Tsereteli, Grebennikova, Lotarevich, &amp; Winikoff, 2016).</p>\n<p>10-13 weeks</p>\n<p>A retrospective cohort study of 1,076 women showed that a combination of 200mg mifepristone followed 36-48 hours later by misoprostol (800mcg vaginally or 600mcg sublingually), and then repeated doses of 400mcg misoprostol vaginally or sublingually every three hours for two additional doses is safe and effective between 9-13 weeks (Hamoda, Ashok, Flett, &amp; Templeton, 2005). All women took misoprostol in the health facility. The success rate for this regimen was high at 95.8%, with a low rate of serious adverse events. A smaller prospective cohort study (Lokeland et al., 2010) including 254 women reported an abortion success rate of 91.7% using a similar regimen. A small prospective cohort study examined effectiveness of mifepristone 200mg orally followed 36-48 hours later by misoprostol 800mcg vaginally as a single dose (Gouk et al., 1999), and found a success rate of 95% among 126 women with pregnancies between 70-83 days.</p>\n<h3>References</h3>\n<p>Abbas, D., Chong, E., &amp; Raymond, E.
