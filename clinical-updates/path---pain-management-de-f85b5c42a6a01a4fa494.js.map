At later gestations, D&amp;E requires more preoperative and operative cervical dilation, longer procedure times and deeper uterine manipulation.</p>\\n<p>Methods of pain management</p>\\n<p>Specific studies of pain control during D&amp;E are lacking, and an optimal regimen for pain management has not been established. Studies focus instead on safety of pain management strategies during D&amp;E, and most international consensus statements focus on the minimum amount of anesthesia at which a D&amp;E can be performed to ensure access at lower-level facilities rather than on optimizing pain control (Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, 2015; World Health Organization, 2014).</p>\\n<p>In studies reporting implementation of D&amp;E programs, pain management usually consists of intravenous sedation with a combination of narcotics and anxiolytics, and a paracervical block (Altman, Stubblefield, Schlam, Loberfeld, &amp; Osathanondh, 1985; Castleman, Oanh, Hyman, Thuy, &amp; Blumenthal, 2006; Jacot et al., 1993). Ipas recommends a combination of paracervical block, NSAIDs and narcotic analgesics, with or without anxiolytics (Edelman &amp; Kapp, 2017). Where available, paracervical block with intravenous sedation should be offered.</p>\\n<p>Local anesthesia</p>\\n<p>See “Pain Management: Paracervical block” on page XXX.</p>\\n<p>Medications</p>\\n<p>No studies assess the effectiveness of oral, intramuscular or intravenous pain medications during D&amp;E. However, studies of vacuum aspiration have found that pre-procedure administration of oral or intramuscular NSAIDs decreases women’s pain during and after the procedure (Braaten, Hurwitz, Fortin &amp; Goldberg, 2013; Renner, Jensen, Nichols, &amp; Edelman, 2010; Romero, Turok, &amp; Gilliam, 2008; Suprapto &amp; Reed, 1984; Wiebe &amp; Rawling, 1995).</p>\\n<p>Intravenous sedation</p>\\n<p>No studies assess the effectiveness of intravenous sedation for pain control during D&amp;E. Studies that have assessed safety of intravenous sedation with fentanyl and midazolam in combination with paracervical block have found rates of major procedure-related complications of less than 1% (Racek, Chen, &amp; Creinin, 2010), and no additional anesthesia-related adverse events (Wilson, Chen, &amp; Creinin, 2009; Wiebe, Byczko, Kaczorowski, &amp; McLane, 2013). Intravenous deep sedation with propofol and without intubation is safe in the outpatient setting, with no reported aspirations and few complications (Dean, Jacobs, Goldstein, Gervitz &amp; Paul, 2011; Mancuso et al., 2017).</p>\\n<p>Providing intravenous sedation increases the expense, complexity and potential risks of an abortion procedure, and requires a trained provider with equipment for patient monitoring.  The increased monitoring necessary to deliver intravenous sedation safely requires facility investments in training and equipment.</p>\\n<p>General anesthesia</p>\\n<p>Although effective for pain control, general anesthesia increases the expense, complexity and potential risks associated with abortion and is not recommended for routine procedures (Atrash, Cheek, &amp; Hogue, 1988; Bartlett et al., 2004; MacKay, Schulz, &amp; Grimes, 1985; WHO, 2014).</p>\\n<p>Non-pharmacologic pain management</p>\\n<p>Medications and paracervical block should be supplemented with supportive techniques to decrease pain and anxiety. Some measures that may be helpful include respectful staff; a clean, secure and private setting; thorough education about what to expect during the procedure; verbal support; gentle and efficient technique; and application of a heating pad or hot water bottle to the lower abdomen in the recovery room (Akin et al., 2001).</p>\\n<h3>References</h3>\\n<p>Akin, M.
