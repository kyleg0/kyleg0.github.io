In the analysis, oral, sublingual and vaginal misoprostol showed similar efficacy and side effect profiles; lengthening the time to follow-up assessment increased the success of misoprostol treatment.</p>\\n<h3>Missed abortion</h3>\\n<p>A 2017 systematic review and network meta-analysis of misoprostol management of missed abortion, which included 18 studies reporting on 1,802 women, concluded that misoprostol 800mcg vaginally or 600mcg sublingually are the most effective treatments (Wu, Marwah, Wang, Wang &amp; Chen, 2017). A single dose of misoprostol 800mcg vaginally results in successful uterine evacuation in 76 to 93%  of women (Fernlund, Jokubkiene, Sladkevicius, &amp; Valentin, 2017; Mizrachi et al., 2017; Ngoc, Blum, Westheimer, Quan, &amp; Winikoff, 2004). In one study, when women were managed expectantly over seven days after a single dose of misoprostol, their complete abortion rates increased over time (Ngoc et al., 2004). Although a number of studies have reported an increase in complete abortion rates when an additional dose of misoprostol is administered 24  (Barcelo et al., 2012; Graziosi, Mol, Ankum, &amp; Bruinse, 2004; Muffley, Stitely, &amp; Gherman, 2002), 48 (Lyra, Cavaco-Gomes, Moucho, &amp; Montenegro, 2017) or 72 hours after the initial dose (Gilles et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2005), it has been unclear whether this is due to the additional medication or the increased time to evaluation. A 2017 trial which randomized women to receive a single dose of misoprostol 800mcg vaginally, or to receive an additional dose of misoprostol after four days, found that both groups had nearly identical completion rates after seven days-77 and 76% respectively (Mizrachi et al., 2017).</p>\\n<p>Misoprostol 600mcg sublingually repeated every three hours following the initial dose for a maximum of two more doses achieves complete abortion rates of 88-92%  (Tang, Lau, Ng, Lee, &amp; Ho, 2003; Tang et al., 2006).

Completion rates were 52-85% for expectant management, 80-99% for treatment with misoprostol, and 91-100% for surgical treatment (Kim et al., 2017). In the analysis, oral, sublingual and vaginal misoprostol showed similar efficacy and side effect profiles; lengthening the time to follow-up assessment increased the success of misoprostol treatment.</p>\\n<h3>Missed abortion</h3>\\n<p>A 2017 systematic review and network meta-analysis of misoprostol management of missed abortion, which included 18 studies reporting on 1,802 women, concluded that misoprostol 800mcg vaginally or 600mcg sublingually are the most effective treatments (Wu, Marwah, Wang, Wang &amp; Chen, 2017). A single dose of misoprostol 800mcg vaginally results in successful uterine evacuation in 76 to 93%  of women (Fernlund, Jokubkiene, Sladkevicius, &amp; Valentin, 2017; Mizrachi et al., 2017; Ngoc, Blum, Westheimer, Quan, &amp; Winikoff, 2004). In one study, when women were managed expectantly over seven days after a single dose of misoprostol, their complete abortion rates increased over time (Ngoc et al., 2004). Although a number of studies have reported an increase in complete abortion rates when an additional dose of misoprostol is administered 24  (Barcelo et al., 2012; Graziosi, Mol, Ankum, &amp; Bruinse, 2004; Muffley, Stitely, &amp; Gherman, 2002), 48 (Lyra, Cavaco-Gomes, Moucho, &amp; Montenegro, 2017) or 72 hours after the initial dose (Gilles et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2005), it has been unclear whether this is due to the additional medication or the increased time to evaluation. A 2017 trial which randomized women to receive a single dose of misoprostol 800mcg vaginally, or to receive an additional dose of misoprostol after four days, found that both groups had nearly identical completion rates after seven days-77 and 76% respectively (Mizrachi et al., 2017).</p>\\n<p>Misoprostol 600mcg sublingually repeated every three hours following the initial dose for a maximum of two more doses achieves complete abortion rates of 88-92%  (Tang, Lau, Ng, Lee, &amp; Ho, 2003; Tang et al., 2006). No studies have evaluated single doses of sublingual misoprostol.</p>\\n<p>A 2015 systematic review assessed if complete abortion rates could be improved by adding mifepristone to misoprostol for treatment of missed abortion (van den Berg, Gordon, Snijders, Vandenbussche, &amp; Coppus, 2015). Authors concluded that existing evidence is insufficient to draw conclusions about the value of adding mifepristone to misoprostol alone for missed abortion.</p>\\n<h3>References</h3>\\n<p>Barcelo, F., De Paco, C., Lopez-Espin, J.
