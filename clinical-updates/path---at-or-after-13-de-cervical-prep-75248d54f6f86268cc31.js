There is limited data to suggest the best method of cervical preparation before D&amp;E because the trials that exist have heterogeneous comparisons, small enrollment numbers, and include few women with pregnancies over 20 weeks. Available trials typically show differences in cervical dilation or procedure times, however they do not include enough participants  to show differences in rare but more serious outcomes such as cervical or uterine injuries or inability to complete the procedure (Newmann et al., 2010). Choice of method of cervical preparation is often limited by supply availability, especially in low-resource settings.</p>\n<p>Possible cervical preparation methods include:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>Method</td>\n<td>Dosing</td>\n<td>Note</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Osmotic dilators (laminaria or synthetic osmotic dilators)</td>\n<td>6-24 hours prior to procedure</td>\n<td>Synthetic osmotic dilators may be used the day of the D&amp;E</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Misoprostol</td>\n<td>400mcg buccally or vaginally 3 hours prior to procedure</td>\n<td>May be used as a single agent up to 18 weeks, only very limited data to support use as a single agent over 18-20 weeks May be combined with osmotic dilators or mifepristone May be repeated as needed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mifepristone</td>\n<td>200mg orally 24-48 hours prior to procedure</td>\n<td>No data to support use as a single agent over 16 weeks Often used prior to misoprostol</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Osmotic dilators</h3>\n<p>Numerous cohort studies have demonstrated that osmotic dilators are safe, effective and do not increase infectious morbidity (Bryman, Granberg, &amp; Norström, 1988; Fox &amp; Krajewski, 2014; Jonasson, Larsson, Bygdeman, &amp; Forsum, 1989; Peterson et al., 1983). A Cochrane meta-analysis of cervical preparation before D&amp;E between 14-24 weeks gestation showed that overnight osmotic dilators provide better cervical dilation when compared to prostaglandins, and decreased procedure time between 13-16 weeks gestation (Newmann et al., 2010). In one randomized controlled trial, synthetic dilators and laminaria worked equally well (Newmann et al., 2014). Decisions about the number and timing of dilators to place should be individualized and take into consideration the type of dilator and its size, the gestational age of the pregnancy, parity and cervical compliance, and the provider’s experience (Fox &amp; Krajewski, 2014; Newmann, Dalve-Endres, &amp; Drey, 2008). Administration of paracervical block prior to dilator insertion eases the discomfort of dilator placement for women (Soon et al., 2017).</p>\n<h3>Misoprostol</h3>\n<p>Misoprostol is inexpensive, safe (Nucatola, Roth, Saulsberry, &amp; Gatter, 2008), and more readily available than osmotic dilators in many low-resource settings. Misoprostol may be used alone for cervical preparation prior to D&amp;E up to 18 weeks gestation (Fox &amp; Krajewski, 2014; O’Connell, Jones, Lichtenberg, &amp; Paul, 2008); there is limited data to support use of misoprostol as a single agent after 18 weeks (Maurer, Jacobson, &amp; Turok, 2013). In studies comparing osmotic dilators to misoprostol, dilators provided more cervical dilation (Goldberg et al., 2005; Sagiv et al., 2015). However, women who received misoprostol for cervical preparation were able to have their procedures safely completed on the same day (Bartz et al., 2013; Goldberg et al., 2005; Sagiv et al., 2015), and women often preferred misoprostol to dilators (Goldberg et al., 2005). Misoprostol may be given to women with a prior cesarean delivery, as uterine rupture is rare (Fox &amp; Krajewski, 2014).</p>\n<h3>Misoprostol plus osmotic dilators</h3>\n<p>Three randomized controlled trials have shown that misoprostol added to overnight laminaria improves cervical dilation between 16-19 weeks gestation (Goldberg et al., 2015), and improves cervical dilation and decreases operating time between 19-21 weeks gestation (Drey et al., 2013; Edelman, Buckmaster, Goetsch, Nichols, &amp; Jensen, 2006) when compared to dilators alone. In all studies, side effects were greater among women using misoprostol. One small prospective randomized trial has examined adding misoprostol to dilators for same-day D&amp;E (Borras et al., 2016). Investigators ended this study early due to an unexpectedly high rate of complications—specifically serious cervical lacerations—in women over 19 weeks gestation who received dilators alone for cervical preparation.</p>\n<h3>Mifepristone</h3>\n<p>One randomized trial of 50 women between 14-16 weeks gestation compared mifepristone as a single agent to dilators, both administered the day prior to the abortion procedure (Borgatta et al., 2012). Women who had cervical preparation with osmotic dilators had a slightly shorter procedure time and greater dilation compared to women given mifepristone, but women had less pain with mifepristone and strongly preferred it. In studies examining the use of mifepristone in combination with misoprostol, same-day administration of mifepristone plus misoprostol is no better than misoprostol alone (Casey, Ye, Perritt, Moreno-Ruiz, &amp; Reeves, 2016), and while administration of mifepristone 2 days prior to misoprostol resulted in improved cervical dilation in one study, the rate of preprocedure fetal expulsions was also increased (Carbonell et al., 2007). When compared to overnight dilators plus misoprostol, mifepristone administered the day prior to the abortion plus same-day misoprostol is less effective (Shaw et al., 2017).</p>\n<h3>Mifepristone plus osmotic dilators</h3>\n<p>Two randomized trials have assessed the addition of mifepristone when women received overnight osmotic dilators plus misoprostol for cervical preparation; neither study showed additional benefit with mifepristone (Shaw et al., 2017; Shaw et al., 2015). A third randomized trial compared overnight dilators alone, overnight dilators plus misoprostol, and overnight dilators plus mifepristone (Goldberg et al., 2015), and found that procedure times were no different between the three groups, although providers reported that procedures between 19-24 weeks gestation were easier in the dilators plus mifepristone group.</p>\n<h3>References</h3>\n<p>Bartz, D., Maurer, R., Allen, R.
