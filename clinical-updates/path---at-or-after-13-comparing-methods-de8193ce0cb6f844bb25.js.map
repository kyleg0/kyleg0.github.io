Overall rates of complications were similar in the two groups, although the types of complications differed.

A pilot randomized trial of 18 women with gestations between 14-19 weeks comparing D&amp;E and medical abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol found a higher rate of adverse events, specifically retained placenta and fever, in women undergoing medical abortion, although none were serious (Grimes, Smith, &amp; Witham, 2004).</p>\\n<p>In published studies of medical abortion compared to D&amp;E, rates of intervention for medical abortion may be artificially high because failure was defined as no delivery within 24 hours (Bryant et al., 2011) and retained placenta was diagnosed after two hours (Grimes et al., 2004).
