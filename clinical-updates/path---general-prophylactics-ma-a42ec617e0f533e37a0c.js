Serious infections requiring hospitalization are very uncommon, with rates in large retrospective studies from the United States ranging from 0.03% to 0.09% (Fjerstad, Trussel, Sivin, Lichtenberg, &amp; Cullins, 2009; Henderson, Hwang, Harper, &amp; Stewart, 2005).</p>\n<p>Infection rates for medical abortion at or after 13 weeks gestation are more difficult to determine, as fever is a common side effect of prostaglandin use. Available data report infection rates of 1-3% following medical abortion at or after 13 weeks gestation (Achilles &amp; Reeves, 2011).</p>\n<p>Infectious mortality</p>\n<p>Nine cases of fatal Clostridium sepsis occurred in North America following mifepristone and misoprostol medical abortion before 13 weeks gestation (Cohen et al., 2007; Fischer et al., 2005; Meites, Zane, &amp; Gould, 2010; Sinave, Le Templier, Blouin, Leveille, &amp; Deland, 2002). One death from group A streptococcus has been reported in Australia and one death from Clostridium sordelli has been reported in Portugal (Reis et al., 2011) in women who used mifepristone and misoprostol. The overall mortality rate from infection related to medical abortion remains very low at 0.58 per 100,000 medical abortions (Meites et al., 2010).</p>\n<p>Prophylactic antibiotics</p>\n<p>There have been no randomized controlled trials examining the effect of antibiotic prophylaxis on medical abortion outcomes (Achilles &amp; Reeves, 2011; Low, Mueller, Van Vliet, &amp; Kapp, 2012). Given the large number of women who would need to take antibiotics to prevent a single infection, coupled with the expense and side effects of antibiotics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2014), the Society of Family Planning (Achilles &amp; Reeves, 2011), the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (2015) and the World Health Organization (WHO, 2014) do not recommend routine antibiotic use prior to medical abortion.</p>\n<p>Therapeutic antibiotics</p>\n<p>Women at high risk should be screened for sexually transmitted infections. Women who have signs and symptoms of sexually transmitted infection should be provided abortion services without delay and receive appropriate antibiotic treatment according to evidence-based regimens (WHO, 2014; WHO, 2005). Partners of women with sexually transmitted infections also require treatment (WHO, 2016).</p>\n<h3>References</h3>\n<p>Achilles, S. L., &amp; Reeves, M. F. (2011).
