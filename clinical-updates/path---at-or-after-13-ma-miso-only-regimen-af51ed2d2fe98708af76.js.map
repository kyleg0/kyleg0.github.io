Vaginal dosing is more effective than sublingual dosing for nulliparous women.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Strength of recommendation: Strong</h3>\\n<h3>Quality of evidence:</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Up to 20 weeks gestation: Moderate</li>\\n<li>20-24 weeks gestation: Low</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Last reviewed: January 9, 2018</h3>\\n<h3>Background</h3>\\n<p>A combination regimen with mifepristone and misoprostol has shorter induction-to-abortion intervals and higher success rates than misoprostol only for medical abortion at or after 13 weeks gestation (Wildschut et al., 2011). If mifepristone is not available, a misoprostol-only regimen with dosing every three hours is an acceptable alternative (Wildschut et al., 2011; World Health Organization (WHO), 2014).</p>\\n<h3>Vaginal route</h3>\\n<p>In randomized controlled clinical trials, misoprostol 400mcg vaginally every three hours is associated with a median induction-to-abortion interval of 10-15 hours and a 48-hour successful abortion rate of 90-95% (Bhattacharjee, Saha, Ghoshroy, Bhowmik, &amp; Barui, 2008; Koh et al., 2017; Tang, Lau, Chan, &amp; Ho, 2004; von Hertzen et al., 2009). A 400mcg dose vaginally is more effective than a 200mcg dose (Koh et al., 2017).</p>\\n<h3>Sublingual route</h3>\\n<p>In a meta-analysis of 1,178 women from three randomized controlled trials, misoprostol 400mcg sublingually is similar (Bhattacharjee et al., 2008) or slightly inferior to vaginal dosing when given every three hours (Tang et al., 2004; von Hertzen et al., 2009; Wildschut et al., 2011). In the trials that showed reduced efficacy, the difference was driven by an inferior response to sublingual misoprostol in nulliparous women only. Of note: all of these studies found that women prefer the sublingual route to vaginal administration by health care workers.</p>\\n<h3>Other routes</h3>\\n<p><em>Buccal route:</em> One trial randomized 130 women to misoprostol 400mcg every three hours either vaginally or buccally. Women in the vaginal group had a shorter mean induction-to-fetal expulsion interval (25 compared to 40 hours, p=0.001) and higher rates of fetal expulsion at both 24 hours (63% compared to 42%, p=0.014) and 48 hours (91% compared to 68%, p=0.001) (Al &amp; Yapca, 2015). A smaller trial of 64 women showed buccal misoprostol was as effective as vaginal; however, all of the women received an initial loading dose of misoprostol 400mcg vaginally and were randomized to 200mcg buccally or vaginally every six hours thereafter (Ellis, Kapp, Vragpvoc, &amp; Borgatta, 2010). Finally, a trial including a cohort of 60 women who received misoprostol 400mcg buccally every three hours until fetal and placental expulsion found a complete abortion rate of 71% at 48 hours (Dabash et al., 2015). Based on these studies, vaginal and sublingual administration appear to be superior to buccal misoprostol dosing in this gestational age range.</p>\\n<p><em>Oral route:</em> In multiple randomized clinical trials, oral dosing has been shown to be less effective with longer time-to-abortion intervals than vaginal or sublingual dosing (Akoury et al., 2004; Bebbington et al., 2002; Behrashi &amp; Mahdian, 2008; Nautiyal, Mukherjee, Perhar, &amp; Banerjee, 2015).</p>\\n<h3>Dosing interval</h3>\\n<p>In one randomized trial that examined two different regimens of vaginal misoprostol, lengthening the dosing interval from every three to every six hours decreases the efficacy of medical abortion (Wong, Ngai, Yeo, Tang, &amp; Ho, 2000).</p>\\n<h3>Quality of evidence</h3>\\n<p>The recommendation is based on multiple randomized clinical trials and a Cochrane meta-analysis comparing different misoprostol doses, dosing intervals and routes of administration at or after 13 weeks gestation (Wildschut et al., 2011). This body of evidence is limited by the fact that most randomized controlled trials of medical abortion do not include women with pregnancies over 20 weeks gestation.</p>\\n<h3>References</h3>\\n<p>Akoury, H.

If mifepristone is not available, a misoprostol-only regimen with dosing every three hours is an acceptable alternative (Wildschut et al., 2011; World Health Organization (WHO), 2014).</p>\\n<h3>Vaginal route</h3>\\n<p>In randomized controlled clinical trials, misoprostol 400mcg vaginally every three hours is associated with a median induction-to-abortion interval of 10-15 hours and a 48-hour successful abortion rate of 90-95% (Bhattacharjee, Saha, Ghoshroy, Bhowmik, &amp; Barui, 2008; Koh et al., 2017; Tang, Lau, Chan, &amp; Ho, 2004; von Hertzen et al., 2009). A 400mcg dose vaginally is more effective than a 200mcg dose (Koh et al., 2017).</p>\\n<h3>Sublingual route</h3>\\n<p>In a meta-analysis of 1,178 women from three randomized controlled trials, misoprostol 400mcg sublingually is similar (Bhattacharjee et al., 2008) or slightly inferior to vaginal dosing when given every three hours (Tang et al., 2004; von Hertzen et al., 2009; Wildschut et al., 2011). In the trials that showed reduced efficacy, the difference was driven by an inferior response to sublingual misoprostol in nulliparous women only. Of note: all of these studies found that women prefer the sublingual route to vaginal administration by health care workers.</p>\\n<h3>Other routes</h3>\\n<p><em>Buccal route:</em> One trial randomized 130 women to misoprostol 400mcg every three hours either vaginally or buccally. Women in the vaginal group had a shorter mean induction-to-fetal expulsion interval (25 compared to 40 hours, p=0.001) and higher rates of fetal expulsion at both 24 hours (63% compared to 42%, p=0.014) and 48 hours (91% compared to 68%, p=0.001) (Al &amp; Yapca, 2015). A smaller trial of 64 women showed buccal misoprostol was as effective as vaginal; however, all of the women received an initial loading dose of misoprostol 400mcg vaginally and were randomized to 200mcg buccally or vaginally every six hours thereafter (Ellis, Kapp, Vragpvoc, &amp; Borgatta, 2010). Finally, a trial including a cohort of 60 women who received misoprostol 400mcg buccally every three hours until fetal and placental expulsion found a complete abortion rate of 71% at 48 hours (Dabash et al., 2015). Based on these studies, vaginal and sublingual administration appear to be superior to buccal misoprostol dosing in this gestational age range.</p>\\n<p><em>Oral route:</em> In multiple randomized clinical trials, oral dosing has been shown to be less effective with longer time-to-abortion intervals than vaginal or sublingual dosing (Akoury et al., 2004; Bebbington et al., 2002; Behrashi &amp; Mahdian, 2008; Nautiyal, Mukherjee, Perhar, &amp; Banerjee, 2015).</p>\\n<h3>Dosing interval</h3>\\n<p>In one randomized trial that examined two different regimens of vaginal misoprostol, lengthening the dosing interval from every three to every six hours decreases the efficacy of medical abortion (Wong, Ngai, Yeo, Tang, &amp; Ho, 2000).</p>\\n<h3>Quality of evidence</h3>\\n<p>The recommendation is based on multiple randomized clinical trials and a Cochrane meta-analysis comparing different misoprostol doses, dosing intervals and routes of administration at or after 13 weeks gestation (Wildschut et al., 2011). This body of evidence is limited by the fact that most randomized controlled trials of medical abortion do not include women with pregnancies over 20 weeks gestation.</p>\\n<h3>References</h3>\\n<p>Akoury, H.
