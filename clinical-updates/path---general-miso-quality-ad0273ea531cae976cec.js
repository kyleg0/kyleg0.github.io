There are at least 30-40 manufacturers of misoprostol worldwide, and some manufacturers subcontract production of the drug, which makes the enforcement of Good Manufacturing Practice and the assurance of quality across all brands difficult (Hall &amp; Tagontong, 2016). Misoprostol brands approved by the European Union or the United States Food and Drug Administration conform to Good Manufacturing Practice and are high quality. Exposure to heat and humidity during manufacturing, packaging and storage may compromise the quality of misoprostol (Cayman Chemical, 2012). If misoprostol degrades, it may lead to decreased success rates with medical abortion and unsuccessful treatment of incomplete abortion and postpartum hemorrhage.</p>\n<p>A 2016 study analyzed 215 misoprostol samples from countries all over the world (Hall &amp; Tagontong, 2016). When samples were tested for content and purity, 5% contained more misoprostol than expected (110-121% of labeled content, to allow for degradation), 55% were within specification (90-100% of labeled content), and 40% were below specification (less than 90% of labeled content).

Misoprostol is stable when stored properly in room temperature conditions (25°C and 60% humidity). There have not been large field studies on the stability of misoprostol when stored in tropical climates, but laboratory studies have shown that misoprostol is less stable when exposed to moisture or heat (Chu, Wang, Pang, &amp; Rogers, 2007; WHO, 2009).</p>\n<p>Misoprostol packaged in double-aluminum blister packs (aluminum on top and bottom) retains the most active ingredient; after one year, 100% of pills packaged in plastic and single-aluminum blister packs will degrade, compared to 28% of misoprostol packaged in double-aluminum blister packs (Hall &amp; Tagontong, 2016). The integrity of the double-aluminum blister packs must be preserved to maintain drug potency. If the packaging is inadvertently opened, even in normal room-temperature conditions, the tablets’ potency degrades within 48 hours and continues to degrade over time (Berard et al., 2014).</p>\n<p>Quality assurance</p>\n<p>If providers notice a decrease in medical abortion success rates from expected baseline, they should discard the lot of misoprostol being used and start a new lot.
