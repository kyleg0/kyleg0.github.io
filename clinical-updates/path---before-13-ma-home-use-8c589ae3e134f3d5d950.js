Because of women’s individual preferences for privacy, support and timing, they should have options about the location of mifepristone and misoprostol use.</p>\n<p><em>Home use of mifepristone</em></p>\n<p>Two prospective, nonrandomized multicenter cohort studies conducted in the United States, which together included 701 women, showed that between a third and a half of women offered home or facility use of mifepristone chose home use (Chong et al., 2015; Swica et al., 2012). Women who used mifepristone at home were highly satisfied and had similar success rates and need for telephone or emergency room support as women who took mifepristone in the clinic. In similar studies conducted in Azerbaijan (Louie et al., 2014), Nepal (Conkling, Karki, Tuladhar, Bracken, &amp; Winikoff, 2015) and Kazakhstan (Platais, Tsereteli, Grebennikova, Lotarevich, &amp; Winikoff, 2016), 74%, 72% and 64% of women, respectively, chose home use. The most commonly cited reasons for the choice to take mifepristone at home were flexibility, ability to schedule abortion around duties, partner’s presence and a more private experience. Abortion success rates were the same in the home use and clinic use groups. When a woman chooses home use of mifepristone, she should take it within one week of the clinic visit at which she received the prescription or medication, provided her pregnancy does not exceed 10 weeks at that time.</p>\n<p><em>Home use of misoprostol up to 70 days</em></p>\n<p>A systematic review of nine prospective comparative cohort studies including 4,522 women up to 56 days gestation showed that complete abortion rates and adverse event rates were the same for home- and facility-based misoprostol use (Ngo, Park, Shakur, &amp; Free, 2011) as part of a mifepristone-misoprostol regimen. Women found home use as acceptable as clinic use. A non-randomized comparative trial including 731 rural and urban Indian women up to 63 days gestation found no difference in abortion success or adverse events between home and facility administration of misoprostol (Iyengar et al., 2016). Large observational studies up to 59 days (Fjerstad et al., 2009) and 63 days (Gatter, Cleland, &amp; Nucatola, 2015; Goldstone, Walker, &amp; Hawtin, 2017; Lokeland, Iversen, Engeland, Okland, &amp; Bjorge, 2014; Louie et al., 2014; Raghavan et al., 2013) also confirmed the safety and efficacy of home use of misoprostol. The World Health Organization (WHO, 2014) and Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG, 2015) recommend home use of misoprostol up to 63 days gestation.</p>\n<p>A multicenter study of 729 women in the United States comparing a single dose of buccal misoprostol 800mcg at home from 57-63 days and from 64-70 days as part of a mifepristone-misoprostol regimen showed no difference between the groups in success rates, ongoing pregnancy or adverse events (Winikoff et al., 2012). A prospective, open-label trial conducted in India, Georgia, Tunisia and Ukraine compared outcomes of 703 women who received mifepristone followed by 400mcg of sublingual misoprostol in the home for pregnancies of 57-63 days or 64-70 days gestation (Bracken et al., 2014). Success rates and ongoing pregnancy rates did not differ between groups, although women in the later gestational age group were more likely to receive an additional dose of misoprostol or require intervention for bleeding. Additional smaller studies have shown similar results (Boersma, Meyboom-de Jong, &amp; Kleiverda, 2011; Platais et al., 2016). The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG, 2014) and the National Abortion Federation (NAF, 2017) recommend offering home use of misoprostol up to 70 days gestation.</p>\n<p><em>Home use of misoprostol from 10-13 weeks</em></p>\n<p>There are no data regarding home use of misoprostol as part of a combined regimen after 10 weeks gestation.</p>\n<p>Misoprostol-only regimen</p>\n<p>No studies have directly compared safety and effectiveness of home use of misoprostol in a misoprostol-only regimen to health facility use. However, several studies with misoprostol-only arms have allowed women to self-administer the medication at home up to nine weeks gestation without an effect on safety or medical abortion success (Blum et al., 2012; Ngoc et al., 2011). Additionally, three small prospective cohort studies of misoprostol-only abortion conducted in Cuba allowed home use of medication up to 9 (Carbonell, Valera, Velazco, Fernandez, &amp; Sanchez, 1997; Velazco et al., 2000), or between 9-12 gestational weeks (Carbonell et al., 2001) without an effect on safety or success. Two studies that enrolled only adolescents (Carbonell et al., 2001; Velazco et al., 2000) found higher rates of nausea and vomiting than observed in studies with adult women.</p>\n<h3>References</h3>\n<p>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
