Presence of products of conception on visual inspection confirms that the pregnancy was intrauterine and is consistent with successful abortion (Westfall, Sophocles, Burggraf, &amp; Ellis, 1998). If products of conception are not seen, a woman should not leave the facility until plans are made for follow-up. Immediate examination of the products of conception can also expedite the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy and decrease related morbidity and mortality (Goldstein, Danon, &amp; Watson, 1994).
