Included studies were from India, South Africa, the United States and Vietnam. Combined data found no difference in the overall risk of complications between physicians and non-physician providers (relative risk [RR] 1.36, 95% CI 0.86, 2.14). When examining risk of incomplete abortion separately, observational data (three studies including 13,715 women) indicated an increased risk of incomplete abortion when performed by midlevel providers (RR 2.25, 95% CI 1.38, 3.68) (Goldman, Occhuito, Peterson, Zapka, &amp; Palmer, 2004; Jejeebhoy et al., 2011; Weitz et al., 2013); this increased risk was not observed in randomized controlled trial data (one study, 2789 women, RR 2.97, 95% CI 0.21, 41.82) (Warriner et al., 2006).</p>\n<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) states that non-specialist doctors, associate and advanced associate clinicians, midwives and nurses can be trained to perform vacuum aspiration for induced abortion (WHO, 2015).

Where doctors of complementary medicine participate in other tasks related to maternal and reproductive health, they can also perform vacuum aspiration.</p>\n<p>Medical abortion</p>\n<p>A 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis comparing medical abortion provision by midlevel providers and doctors (Sjostrom, Dragoman, Fonhus, Ganatra, &amp; Gemzell-Danielsson, 2017) included three randomized controlled trials, reporting outcomes for 3,670 women from Mexico, Nepal and Sweden. Midlevel providers in the included studies were nurses, auxiliary nurse midwives, ayurvedic (traditional) physicians and midwives. The review found that effectiveness, measured as rate of complete pregnancy termination, was equivalent between the physician and non-physician groups (RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.99, 1.02). Across all included studies, only one serious adverse event—heavy bleeding requiring uterine aspiration—was recorded. Authors concluded that although the rarity of such events limits the ability to statistically analyze their likelihood based on provider type, the overall low rate was reassuring.</p>\n<p>WHO states that, in addition to specialist and non-specialist doctors, associate and advanced associate clinicians, midwives, nurses, auxiliary nurses and auxiliary nurse midwives can be trained to provide medical abortion. Where doctors of complementary medicine participate in other tasks related to maternal and reproductive health, they can also provide medical abortion.
