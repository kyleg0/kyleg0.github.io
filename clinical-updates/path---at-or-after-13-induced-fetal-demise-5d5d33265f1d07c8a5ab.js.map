A retrospective cohort study comparing women with digoxin injection prior to D&amp;E with historical controls who did not receive digoxin showed an increase in complications, including more hospital admissions, extramural deliveries and infections in women who received digoxin (Dean et al., 2012). One case series, which included nearly 5,000 D&amp;E abortions performed between 18 and 24 weeks after digoxin injection found rates of extramural deliveries (0.3%) and infection (0.04%) that authors concluded were acceptably low (Steward, Melamed, Kim, Nucatola, &amp; Gatter, 2012). There are no trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of induced fetal demise before medical abortion with the currently recommended regimens for use at or after 13 weeks. There is no evidence that shows a medical benefit for the practice.</p>\\n<h3>Technique</h3>\\n<p>Fetal demise can be achieved prior to abortion at or after 13 weeks by injecting potassium chloride directly into the fetal heart or digoxin into the fetus or amniotic fluid.</p>\\n<p><em>Potassium chloride: </em>Potassium chloride injection requires skill in ultrasound guidance techniques and has more potential risk due to the possibility of maternal intravascular injection which can cause cardiac arrest (Borgatta &amp; Kapp, 2011; Coke, Baschat, Mighty, &amp; Malinow, 2004). It is not recommended in a low-resource setting.</p>\\n<p><em>Digoxin:</em> In a pharmacokinetic study of eight women between 19-23 weeks who had intra-amniotic injection of digoxin 1mg prior to D&amp;E, maternal serum digoxin levels were in the low therapeutic range and were not associated with cardiac changes (Drey, Thomas, Benowitz, Goldschlager, &amp; Darney, 2000). A pilot randomized trial of intra-amniotic or intra-fetal digoxin at doses of 1mg or 1.5mg showed an overall rate of fetal demise of 87% with no difference in effectiveness based on the dose or route of administration (Nucatola, Roth, &amp; Gatter, 2010). To be effective, digoxin intra-amniotic injection should be performed 1-2 days before the planned abortion procedure. Digoxin may be given transabdominally or transvaginally (Tocce, Sheeder, Edwards, &amp; Teal, 2013).</p>\\n<h3>References</h3>\\n<p>Borgatta, L., &amp; Kapp, N. (2011). Clinical guidelines.
