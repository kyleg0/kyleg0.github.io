In studies performed in the United States prior to routine use of antibiotic prophylaxis, reported rates of infection following D&amp;E ranged from 0.8-1.6% (Achilles &amp; Reeves, 2011).</p>\n<h3>Evidence for antibiotic prophylaxis</h3>\n<p>A Cochrane meta-analysis of 19 randomized controlled clinical trials showed that administration of prophylactic antibiotics at the time of vacuum aspiration for induced abortion before 13 weeks gestation significantly reduces the risk of infection (Low, Mueller, Van Vliet, &amp; Kapp, 2012). Evidence to support use of prophylactic antibiotics before D&amp;E is limited; however, because of the demonstrated benefit of prophylactic antibiotics before vacuum aspiration, the World Health Organization (WHO, 2014), Society of Family Planning (Achilles &amp; Reeves, 2011), American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG, 2016) and Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG, 2015) recommend prophylactic antibiotics for all women undergoing vacuum aspiration or D&amp;E.</p>\n<p>Four randomized trials have examined the use of prophylactic antibiotics before vacuum aspiration or curettage for incomplete or missed abortion (postabortion care) (Prieto, Eriksen, &amp; Blanco, 1995; Ramin et al., 1995; Seeras, 1989; Titipant &amp; Cherdchoogieat, 2012). None of these studies found a statistically significant difference in postabortion infection rates between the groups that received antibiotic prophylaxis and those that received placebo or no treatment, however all studies suffered from serious methodologic flaws that limit the conclusions that can be drawn from them. Given the paucity of higher-quality evidence, and data indicating the benefit of routine prophylactic antibiotics before vacuum aspiration for induced abortion, it is prudent to administer prophylactic antibiotics for vacuum aspiration when used for postabortion care (Achilles &amp; Reeves, 2011; RCOG, 2016).</p>\n<p>Giving prophylactic antibiotics is more effective than screening all women and treating only those with evidence of infection (Levallois &amp; Rioux, 1988). The inability to provide antibiotics should not limit access to abortion (WHO, 2014), as the overall risk of infection with abortion procedures is very low.</p>\n<h3>Regimen</h3>\n<p>Many antibiotic regimens for abortion prophylaxis have been studied, but the ideal antibiotic, dose and timing has not yet been established (Achilles &amp; Reeves, 2011; Low et al., 2012). Tetracyclines (doxycycline) and nitroimidazoles (metronidazole and tinidazole) are commonly used because of their efficacy, oral availability, low cost and low risk of allergic reactions (Achilles &amp; Reeves, 2011; O&#8217;Connell, Jones, Lichtenberg, &amp; Paul, 2008). Although studies of abortion are limited (Caruso et al., 2008), evidence from the obstetrical (Costantine et al., 2008), gynecologic (Mittendorf et al., 1993) and general surgery (Classen et al., 1992) literature supports the practice of giving antibiotics before the procedure to decrease the risk of infection. Antibiotic regimens do not need to be continued after the abortion (Achilles &amp; Reeves, 2011; Caruso, et al., 2008; Levallois &amp; Rioux, 1988; Lichtenberg &amp; Shott, 2003).</p>\n<p>The following table lists regimens recommended by professional organizations based on clinical evidence and expert opinion.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>Common Regimens</td>\n<td>Recommender</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Doxycycline 200mg orally before the procedure<br />\n<em>or</em><br />\nAzithromycin 500mg orally before the procedure<br />\n<em>or </em><br />\nMetronidazole 500mg orally before the procedure</td>\n<td>​Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA, 2016)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Doxycycline 200mg orally no more than 2 hours before the procedure<br />\n<em>or</em><br />\nAzithromycin 500mg orally no more than 2 hours before the procedure</td>\n<td>Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG, 2015)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Antibiotics with osmotic dilators</h3>\n<p>Although not well studied, cervical preparation with osmotic dilators does not appear to increase the risk of infection (Fox &amp; Krajewski, 2014; Jonasson, Larsson, Bygdeman, &amp; Forsum, 1989). Some providers start antibiotics at the time of osmotic dilator placement, but there are no studies evaluating the benefit of this practice (O&#8217;Connell et al., 2008).</p>\n<h3>Therapeutic antibiotics</h3>\n<p>Women at high risk should be screened for sexually transmitted infections in addition to receiving prophylactic antibiotics. Women who have signs and symptoms of sexually transmitted infection should be provided abortion services without delay and receive appropriate antibiotic treatment according to evidence-based regimens (WHO, 2014; WHO, 2005). Partners of women with sexually transmitted infections also require treatment (WHO, 2016).</p>\n<h3>References</h3>\n<p>Achilles, S. L., &amp; Reeves, M. F. (2011).
