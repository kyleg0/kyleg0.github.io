Where mifepristone is unavailable, the misoprostol-only regimen may be used.</p>\\n<p>Mifepristone and misoprostol</p>\\n<p><em>Effectiveness</em></p>\\n<p>Medical abortion success is defined as a complete abortion that needs no further intervention. A 2015 systematic review reported data from 20 studies that included a total of 33,846 women undergoing medical abortion with mifepristone and buccal misoprostol through 70 days gestation (Chen &amp; Creinin, 2015). The overall success rate was 96.6% and the continuing pregnancy rate was 0.8% Two prospective cohort studies have examined mifepristone combined with either 400mcg or 600mcg of sublingual misoprostol through 70 days gestation, finding success rates of 93-99% and ongoing pregnancy rates of less than 2% (Bracken et al., 2014; Platais, Tsereteli, Grebennikova, Lotarevich, &amp; Winikoff, 2016). One prospective cohort study has examined mifepristone combined with vaginal misoprostol from 63-70 days gestation, finding a success rate of 95% (Gouk et al., 1999).</p>\\n<p>Between 10 and 13 weeks gestation only one available study, a retrospective cohort study of 1,076 women, has used the currently recommended regimen of 200mg mifepristone followed 36-48 hours later by misoprostol (800mcg vaginally or 600mcg sublingually), and then repeated doses of 400mcg misoprostol vaginally or sublingually every three hours for two additional doses (Hamoda, Ashok, Flett, &amp; Templeton, 2005). The success rate for this regimen was 95.8%, with an ongoing pregnancy rate of 1.5%. A smaller prospective cohort study which included 254 women used a similar regimen and reported a success rate of 91.7% and an ongoing pregnancy rate of less than 1% (Lokeland et al., 2010).</p>\\n<p><em>Safety</em></p>\\n<p>Three large cohort studies, including a total of 260,256 women, have reported complications observed during medical abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol up to nine weeks gestation (Cleland et al., 2013; Gatter, Cleland, &amp; Nucatola, 2015; Goldstone, Walker, &amp; Hawtin, 2017). These studies found rates of incomplete abortion requiring uterine aspiration of 2.3 to 4.8%; rates of all other outcomes, such as ongoing pregnancy, unrecognized ectopic pregnancy, and complications were less than 1%. Between 10 and 13 weeks, reported rates of uterine aspiration for any reason range from 4-8% (Hamoda et al., 2005; Lokeland et al., 2010) and complication rates are around 3% (Hamoda et al., 2005).</p>\\n<p>A large retrospective cohort study of 11,319 first-trimester medical abortions evaluated all complications from abortions provided in the state of California in the United States from 2009-2010 (Upadhyay et al., 2015). Researchers assessed complications arising at the time of the abortion, as well as complications diagnosed when patients sought additional care from sites other than the site where the abortion was provided, such as emergency departments. The overall rate of complications during the six weeks following medical abortion was 5.2%; only 0.3% were major complications—defined as requiring hospitalization, surgery or blood transfusion. Complications included incomplete abortion (0.87%), failed abortion (0.13%), hemorrhage (0.14%), infection (0.23%) and undetermined/other (3.82%).</p>\\n<p>INSERT TABLE HERE</p>\\n<p>Misoprostol only</p>\\n<p>Safety and effectiveness data for medical abortion with misoprostol only are more limited. Large retrospective case series documenting success and complication rates are not available. Disparate regimens, gestational age ranges, timeframes to measure abortion success and reporting of complications makes comparison of success and complication rates across studies of misoprostol-only medical abortion difficult.</p>\\n<p><em>Effectiveness</em></p>\\n<p>The largest randomized trial using the recommended misoprostol-only regimen, repeated doses of 800mcg of misoprostol by either the vaginal or sublingual route, included 2,046 women with gestations of seven weeks or less (von Hertzen et al., 2007). Success of misoprostol-only abortion was 84%. Smaller studies using similar regimens have reported success rates of 92% for gestations up to eight weeks (Fekih, 2010), 89-91% up to nine weeks (Salakos et al., 2005; Velazco et al., 2000), and from 84-87% from 9-13 weeks (Carbonell, Varela, Velazco, Tanda &amp; Sanchez, 1999; Carbonell Esteve et al., 1998, Carbonell et al., 2001).</p>\\n<p>In general, higher rates of success with misoprostol-only regimens are associated with lower gestational ages (von Hertzen et al., 2007; Zikopoulos et al., 2002), higher number of repeat doses of misoprostol (Carbonell et al., 1999; Jain, Dutton, Harwood, Meckstroth, &amp; Mishell, 2002) and a longer time period before provider follow-up to confirm abortion success (Bugalho, Mocumbi, Faundes, &amp; David, 2000).</p>\\n<p><em>Safety</em></p>\\n<p>The most commonly reported complications with misoprostol-only medical abortion are incomplete and failed abortion requiring aspiration. In studies that used the recommended misoprostol-only regimen or similar regimens, the rate of aspiration for any reason ranges from 12-17%, with ongoing pregnancy rates of 3-10% (Carbonell et al., 1999; Carbonell et al., 2001; Velazco et al., 2000; von Hertzen et al., 2007). Other complications are infrequently reported: Bleeding requiring aspiration occurs in 1-4% of women (Velazco et al., 2000; Salakos et al., 2005; Carbonell et al., 1999; Carbonell Esteve et al., 1998), transfusion is required in less than 1% of women (von Hertzen, et al., 2007; Carbonell et al., 1999), and infection is reported in 1-4% of women (Velazco et al., 2000; Carbonell et al., 2001; von Hertzen et al., 2007; Carbonell et al., 1999).</p>\\n<h3>References</h3>\\n<p>Blum, J., Raghavan, S., Dabash, R., Ngoc, N.

Where mifepristone is unavailable, the misoprostol-only regimen may be used.</p>\\n<p>Mifepristone and misoprostol</p>\\n<p><em>Effectiveness</em></p>\\n<p>Medical abortion success is defined as a complete abortion that needs no further intervention. A 2015 systematic review reported data from 20 studies that included a total of 33,846 women undergoing medical abortion with mifepristone and buccal misoprostol through 70 days gestation (Chen &amp; Creinin, 2015). The overall success rate was 96.6% and the continuing pregnancy rate was 0.8% Two prospective cohort studies have examined mifepristone combined with either 400mcg or 600mcg of sublingual misoprostol through 70 days gestation, finding success rates of 93-99% and ongoing pregnancy rates of less than 2% (Bracken et al., 2014; Platais, Tsereteli, Grebennikova, Lotarevich, &amp; Winikoff, 2016). One prospective cohort study has examined mifepristone combined with vaginal misoprostol from 63-70 days gestation, finding a success rate of 95% (Gouk et al., 1999).</p>\\n<p>Between 10 and 13 weeks gestation only one available study, a retrospective cohort study of 1,076 women, has used the currently recommended regimen of 200mg mifepristone followed 36-48 hours later by misoprostol (800mcg vaginally or 600mcg sublingually), and then repeated doses of 400mcg misoprostol vaginally or sublingually every three hours for two additional doses (Hamoda, Ashok, Flett, &amp; Templeton, 2005). The success rate for this regimen was 95.8%, with an ongoing pregnancy rate of 1.5%. A smaller prospective cohort study which included 254 women used a similar regimen and reported a success rate of 91.7% and an ongoing pregnancy rate of less than 1% (Lokeland et al., 2010).</p>\\n<p><em>Safety</em></p>\\n<p>Three large cohort studies, including a total of 260,256 women, have reported complications observed during medical abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol up to nine weeks gestation (Cleland et al., 2013; Gatter, Cleland, &amp; Nucatola, 2015; Goldstone, Walker, &amp; Hawtin, 2017). These studies found rates of incomplete abortion requiring uterine aspiration of 2.3 to 4.8%; rates of all other outcomes, such as ongoing pregnancy, unrecognized ectopic pregnancy, and complications were less than 1%. Between 10 and 13 weeks, reported rates of uterine aspiration for any reason range from 4-8% (Hamoda et al., 2005; Lokeland et al., 2010) and complication rates are around 3% (Hamoda et al., 2005).</p>\\n<p>A large retrospective cohort study of 11,319 first-trimester medical abortions evaluated all complications from abortions provided in the state of California in the United States from 2009-2010 (Upadhyay et al., 2015). Researchers assessed complications arising at the time of the abortion, as well as complications diagnosed when patients sought additional care from sites other than the site where the abortion was provided, such as emergency departments. The overall rate of complications during the six weeks following medical abortion was 5.2%; only 0.3% were major complications—defined as requiring hospitalization, surgery or blood transfusion. Complications included incomplete abortion (0.87%), failed abortion (0.13%), hemorrhage (0.14%), infection (0.23%) and undetermined/other (3.82%).</p>\\n<p>INSERT TABLE HERE</p>\\n<p>Misoprostol only</p>\\n<p>Safety and effectiveness data for medical abortion with misoprostol only are more limited. Large retrospective case series documenting success and complication rates are not available. Disparate regimens, gestational age ranges, timeframes to measure abortion success and reporting of complications makes comparison of success and complication rates across studies of misoprostol-only medical abortion difficult.</p>\\n<p><em>Effectiveness</em></p>\\n<p>The largest randomized trial using the recommended misoprostol-only regimen, repeated doses of 800mcg of misoprostol by either the vaginal or sublingual route, included 2,046 women with gestations of seven weeks or less (von Hertzen et al., 2007). Success of misoprostol-only abortion was 84%. Smaller studies using similar regimens have reported success rates of 92% for gestations up to eight weeks (Fekih, 2010), 89-91% up to nine weeks (Salakos et al., 2005; Velazco et al., 2000), and from 84-87% from 9-13 weeks (Carbonell, Varela, Velazco, Tanda &amp; Sanchez, 1999; Carbonell Esteve et al., 1998, Carbonell et al., 2001).</p>\\n<p>In general, higher rates of success with misoprostol-only regimens are associated with lower gestational ages (von Hertzen et al., 2007; Zikopoulos et al., 2002), higher number of repeat doses of misoprostol (Carbonell et al., 1999; Jain, Dutton, Harwood, Meckstroth, &amp; Mishell, 2002) and a longer time period before provider follow-up to confirm abortion success (Bugalho, Mocumbi, Faundes, &amp; David, 2000).</p>\\n<p><em>Safety</em></p>\\n<p>The most commonly reported complications with misoprostol-only medical abortion are incomplete and failed abortion requiring aspiration. In studies that used the recommended misoprostol-only regimen or similar regimens, the rate of aspiration for any reason ranges from 12-17%, with ongoing pregnancy rates of 3-10% (Carbonell et al., 1999; Carbonell et al., 2001; Velazco et al., 2000; von Hertzen et al., 2007). Other complications are infrequently reported: Bleeding requiring aspiration occurs in 1-4% of women (Velazco et al., 2000; Salakos et al., 2005; Carbonell et al., 1999; Carbonell Esteve et al., 1998), transfusion is required in less than 1% of women (von Hertzen, et al., 2007; Carbonell et al., 1999), and infection is reported in 1-4% of women (Velazco et al., 2000; Carbonell et al., 2001; von Hertzen et al., 2007; Carbonell et al., 1999).</p>\\n<h3>References</h3>\\n<p>Blum, J., Raghavan, S., Dabash, R., Ngoc, N.

In studies that used the recommended misoprostol-only regimen or similar regimens, the rate of aspiration for any reason ranges from 12-17%, with ongoing pregnancy rates of 3-10% (Carbonell et al., 1999; Carbonell et al., 2001; Velazco et al., 2000; von Hertzen et al., 2007). Other complications are infrequently reported: Bleeding requiring aspiration occurs in 1-4% of women (Velazco et al., 2000; Salakos et al., 2005; Carbonell et al., 1999; Carbonell Esteve et al., 1998), transfusion is required in less than 1% of women (von Hertzen, et al., 2007; Carbonell et al., 1999), and infection is reported in 1-4% of women (Velazco et al., 2000; Carbonell et al., 2001; von Hertzen et al., 2007; Carbonell et al., 1999).</p>\\n<h3>References</h3>\\n<p>Blum, J., Raghavan, S., Dabash, R., Ngoc, N.
