The World Health Organization (WHO) has determined that routine follow-up after medical abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol is not required (2014). Multiple strategies have been examined to confirm a successful medical abortion and identify rare ongoing pregnancies when using the mifepristone and misoprostol regimen.</p>\\n<p><em>Women’s assessment of successful abortion</em></p>\\n<p>Evidence indicates that women can accurately determine when their mifepristone and misoprostol medical abortion is successful—that is, whether pregnancy expulsion has occurred. In studies comparing women’s assessments of expulsion based on their symptoms to those made by clinicians (Cameron, Glasier, Johnstone, Dewart, &amp; Campbell, 2015; Clark et al., 2010; Perriera et al., 2010; Rossi, Creinin, &amp; Meyn, 2004) and by ultrasound (Rossi et al., 2004), women have repeatedly proven to be nearly as accurate as both.</p>\\n<p><em>Clinical assessment</em></p>\\n<p>Providers may help confirm successful mifepristone and misoprostol abortion at a follow-up visit by reviewing a patient history and performing a bimanual exam if indicated. In studies comparing clinical assessment to ultrasound (Rossi et al., 2004; Pymar, Creinin, &amp; Schwartz, 2001), clinicians determined pregnancy expulsion with high levels of accuracy.</p>\\n<p><em>Ultrasound</em></p>\\n<p>Ultrasound can be used to confirm successful abortion but is not necessary and can add to the cost and complexity of medical abortion, particularly where providers are inexperienced in reading post-medical abortion ultrasound (Kaneshiro, Edelman, Sneeringer, &amp; Ponce de Leon, 2011). Ultrasound is helpful in cases where there is doubt about the presence of an ongoing pregnancy.</p>\\n<p><em>Serum pregnancy testing</em></p>\\n<p>Serum pregnancy testing has been used as an alternative to ultrasound to diagnose an ongoing pregnancy following mifepristone and misoprostol and compares favorably to ultrasound in reducing interventions at the time of follow-up (Clark, Panton, Hann, &amp; Gold, 2007; Dayananda, Maurer, Fortin, &amp; Goldberg, 2013; Fiala, Safar, Bygdeman, &amp; Gemzell-Danielsson, 2003). Serum pregnancy testing is only useful when a pre-treatment hCG has been obtained for comparison; hCG declines by more than 90% seven days after mifepristone is administered in the case of a successful medical abortion (Pocius et al., 2016). Serum pregnancy testing is useful only where laboratory testing is readily accessible.</p>\\n<p><em>Urine pregnancy testing</em></p>\\n<p>A negative urine pregnancy test is reassuring that an abortion has been successful. Rarely, however, a pregnancy test is negative but a woman is still pregnant (false negative). Both high-sensitivity and low-sensitivity urine pregnancy tests can have positive results even when the medical abortion has been successful (false positive) (Cameron, Glasier, Dewart, Johnstone, &amp; Burnside, 2012; Clark et al., 2010; Godfrey, Anderson, Fielding, Meyn, &amp; Creinin, 2007; Perriera et al., 2010). A number of studies have examined use of low-sensitivity (Cameron et al., 2012, Cameron et al., 2015; Constant, Harries, Daskilewicz, Myer, &amp; Gemzell-Danielsson, 2017; Iyengar et al., 2015; Michie &amp; Cameron, 2014) and semi-quantitative or multi-level  (Oppegaard et al., 2015; Raymond et al., 2017a; Raymond et al., 2017b) urine pregnancy tests, often in combination with a symptom checklist, to confirm a successful abortion or identify an ongoing pregnancy without returning for follow-up. A 2017 meta-analysis, which included seven studies that examined use of multi-level pregnancy tests to confirm abortion success when using the combined regimen up to 9 weeks gestation, found that the tests identified all continuing pregnancies (21 out of 1,599 participants, 1.3%) and that most women can successfully perform the tests themselves at home (Raymond et al., 2017a).</p>\\n<p>Medical abortion with misoprostol only<strong><br />\\n</strong>Due to the lower success rate (85%) and higher rate of ongoing pregnancy following misoprostol-only medical abortion before 13 weeks gestation (von Hertzen et al., 2007), WHO recommends routine clinic follow-up for all women undergoing medical abortion with misoprostol only to ensure success of the abortion (WHO, 2014).</p>\\n<p><em>Follow-up assessment</em><strong><br />\\n</strong>There are no studies examining different strategies to determine abortion success when using the misoprostol-only regimen. Possible follow-up strategies, extrapolated from studies about the combined regimen (detailed above) and programmatic data, include a history and physical examination, bimanual examination, ultrasound and/or a serum or urine pregnancy testing to rule out an ongoing pregnancy.</p>\\n<h3>References</h3>\\n<p>Cameron, S.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has determined that routine follow-up after medical abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol is not required (2014). Multiple strategies have been examined to confirm a successful medical abortion and identify rare ongoing pregnancies when using the mifepristone and misoprostol regimen.</p>\\n<p><em>Women’s assessment of successful abortion</em></p>\\n<p>Evidence indicates that women can accurately determine when their mifepristone and misoprostol medical abortion is successful—that is, whether pregnancy expulsion has occurred. In studies comparing women’s assessments of expulsion based on their symptoms to those made by clinicians (Cameron, Glasier, Johnstone, Dewart, &amp; Campbell, 2015; Clark et al., 2010; Perriera et al., 2010; Rossi, Creinin, &amp; Meyn, 2004) and by ultrasound (Rossi et al., 2004), women have repeatedly proven to be nearly as accurate as both.</p>\\n<p><em>Clinical assessment</em></p>\\n<p>Providers may help confirm successful mifepristone and misoprostol abortion at a follow-up visit by reviewing a patient history and performing a bimanual exam if indicated. In studies comparing clinical assessment to ultrasound (Rossi et al., 2004; Pymar, Creinin, &amp; Schwartz, 2001), clinicians determined pregnancy expulsion with high levels of accuracy.</p>\\n<p><em>Ultrasound</em></p>\\n<p>Ultrasound can be used to confirm successful abortion but is not necessary and can add to the cost and complexity of medical abortion, particularly where providers are inexperienced in reading post-medical abortion ultrasound (Kaneshiro, Edelman, Sneeringer, &amp; Ponce de Leon, 2011). Ultrasound is helpful in cases where there is doubt about the presence of an ongoing pregnancy.</p>\\n<p><em>Serum pregnancy testing</em></p>\\n<p>Serum pregnancy testing has been used as an alternative to ultrasound to diagnose an ongoing pregnancy following mifepristone and misoprostol and compares favorably to ultrasound in reducing interventions at the time of follow-up (Clark, Panton, Hann, &amp; Gold, 2007; Dayananda, Maurer, Fortin, &amp; Goldberg, 2013; Fiala, Safar, Bygdeman, &amp; Gemzell-Danielsson, 2003). Serum pregnancy testing is only useful when a pre-treatment hCG has been obtained for comparison; hCG declines by more than 90% seven days after mifepristone is administered in the case of a successful medical abortion (Pocius et al., 2016). Serum pregnancy testing is useful only where laboratory testing is readily accessible.</p>\\n<p><em>Urine pregnancy testing</em></p>\\n<p>A negative urine pregnancy test is reassuring that an abortion has been successful. Rarely, however, a pregnancy test is negative but a woman is still pregnant (false negative). Both high-sensitivity and low-sensitivity urine pregnancy tests can have positive results even when the medical abortion has been successful (false positive) (Cameron, Glasier, Dewart, Johnstone, &amp; Burnside, 2012; Clark et al., 2010; Godfrey, Anderson, Fielding, Meyn, &amp; Creinin, 2007; Perriera et al., 2010). A number of studies have examined use of low-sensitivity (Cameron et al., 2012, Cameron et al., 2015; Constant, Harries, Daskilewicz, Myer, &amp; Gemzell-Danielsson, 2017; Iyengar et al., 2015; Michie &amp; Cameron, 2014) and semi-quantitative or multi-level  (Oppegaard et al., 2015; Raymond et al., 2017a; Raymond et al., 2017b) urine pregnancy tests, often in combination with a symptom checklist, to confirm a successful abortion or identify an ongoing pregnancy without returning for follow-up. A 2017 meta-analysis, which included seven studies that examined use of multi-level pregnancy tests to confirm abortion success when using the combined regimen up to 9 weeks gestation, found that the tests identified all continuing pregnancies (21 out of 1,599 participants, 1.3%) and that most women can successfully perform the tests themselves at home (Raymond et al., 2017a).</p>\\n<p>Medical abortion with misoprostol only<strong><br />\\n</strong>Due to the lower success rate (85%) and higher rate of ongoing pregnancy following misoprostol-only medical abortion before 13 weeks gestation (von Hertzen et al., 2007), WHO recommends routine clinic follow-up for all women undergoing medical abortion with misoprostol only to ensure success of the abortion (WHO, 2014).</p>\\n<p><em>Follow-up assessment</em><strong><br />\\n</strong>There are no studies examining different strategies to determine abortion success when using the misoprostol-only regimen. Possible follow-up strategies, extrapolated from studies about the combined regimen (detailed above) and programmatic data, include a history and physical examination, bimanual examination, ultrasound and/or a serum or urine pregnancy testing to rule out an ongoing pregnancy.</p>\\n<h3>References</h3>\\n<p>Cameron, S.
