The risk of uterine rupture for any woman undergoing a medical abortion at or after 13 weeks gestation is very rare, occurring in fewer than 1 in 1,000 women (Goyal, 2009). In a meta-analysis of 16 studies of 3,556 women undergoing medical abortion at or after 13 weeks gestation with combined or misoprostol-only regimens, three women suffered uterine rupture resulting in a rate of 0.28% with a previous cesarean section and 0.04% without (Goyal, 2009).</p>\n<p>One single-center retrospective review of 279 women undergoing abortion between 14-26 weeks included 60 women with one and 26 women with more than one uterine scar (Küçükgöz Güleç et al., 2013). Women received misoprostol 200mcg vaginally every four hours; three had a uterine rupture. In another retrospective review of 263 women between 12-24 weeks undergoing misoprostol-only abortion, 48 had one and 29 had more than one scar; one rupture was observed in a woman with three prior cesarean sections who received a misoprostol regimen of 200mcg sublingually every three hours (Cetin et al., 2016). A third retrospective review included 231 women with one and 37 women with two prior cesarean deliveries, and used a regimen of 800mcg of misoprostol as a loading dose followed by 200mcg every two hours for three doses; no women experienced rupture (Torriente, Steinberg, &amp; Joubert, 2017).</p>\n<h3>Regimen for women with a uterine scar</h3>\n<p>Due to the rarity of uterine rupture in women with a previous scar, no clear guidance can be obtained from the published literature (Borgatta &amp; Kapp, 2011; Daponte, Nzewenga, Dimopoulos, &amp; Guidozzi, 2006; Daskalakis et al., 2004; Dickinson, 2005; Morris et al., 2017).</p>\n<p>Expert opinion supports:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No change in medical abortion regimen for women with one uterine scar whose gestation is less than 22-24 weeks.</li>\n<li>After 22-24 weeks gestation with a single uterine scar or 13-24 weeks gestation with more than one uterine scar:\n<ul>\n<li>Consider decreasing the dose of misoprostol with or without lengthening the dosing interval (Ho et al., 2007; Küçükgöz Güleç et al., 2013).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is insufficient evidence to know  if changing the dosing regimen will decrease the risk of uterine rupture.</p>\n<h3>References</h3>\n<p>Borgatta, L., &amp; Kapp, N.
