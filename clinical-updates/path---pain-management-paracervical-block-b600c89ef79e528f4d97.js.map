In subsequent studies, the same authors found a four-point injection technique was superior to a two-point injection technique (Renner et al., 2016). Deeper injection (3cm) improves pain management compared to superficial (1.5cm) injection (Cetin, &amp; Cetin, 1997; Renner, Jensen, Nichols, &amp; Edelman, 2010).

In subsequent studies, the same authors found a four-point injection technique was superior to a two-point injection technique (Renner et al., 2016). Deeper injection (3cm) improves pain management compared to superficial (1.5cm) injection (Cetin, &amp; Cetin, 1997; Renner, Jensen, Nichols, &amp; Edelman, 2010). A waiting period between injection and cervical dilation is not necessary as it does not improve pain control (Phair, Jensen, &amp; Nichols, 2002; Renner et al., 2016; Wiebe &amp; Rawling, 1995).</p>\\n<p>In women who receive sedation for pain management, it is unclear if there is additional benefit to administering paracervical block (Kan, Ng, &amp; Ho, 2004; Renner et al., 2010; Wells, 1992; Wong, Ng, Ngai, &amp; Ho, 2002). When women receive general anesthesia, there is no additional benefit to administering paracervical block (Hall, Ekblom, Persson, &amp; Irestedt, 1997; Renner et al., 2010).</p>\\n<p><em>Dilatation and evacuation</em></p>\\n<p>No studies have evaluated paracervical block for pain management during D&amp;E procedures without concomitant sedation or anesthesia. One randomized trial has examined paracervical block use during D&amp;E when women also received deep sedation or general anesthesia; the addition of paracervical block did not improve postoperative pain (Lazenby, Fogelson, &amp; Aeby, 2009). The recommendation to perform paracervical block for D&amp;E has been extrapolated from data from vacuum aspiration studies and one randomized controlled trial of 41 women undergoing D&amp;E which found significantly decreased pain during osmotic dilator placement when paracervical block was used (Soon, Tschann, Salcedo, Stevens, Ahn, &amp; Kaneshiro, 2017).</p>\\n<p><em>Medical abortion</em></p>\\n<p>No studies evaluate use of paracervical block for pain management during medical abortion before 13 weeks gestation. Two studies examining use of paracervical block during medical abortion at or after 13 weeks found no improvement in women’s pain with this modality (Andersson, Benson, Christensson, &amp; Gemzell-Danielsson, 2016; Winkler, Wolters, Funk, &amp; Rath, 1997).</p>\\n<p>Midlevel providers</p>\\n<p>In an international, randomized multi-center study examining 2,894 procedures, midlevel providers had similar complication rates as physicians when performing vacuum aspiration with paracervical block (Warriner et al., 2006). The midlevel providers experienced no complications related to use of paracervical block.</p>\\n<p>Technique</p>\\n<p>More information on paracervical block technique can be found in the “Paracervical block technique” additional resource on page XXX.</p>\\n<h3>References</h3>\\n<p>Andersson, I.
