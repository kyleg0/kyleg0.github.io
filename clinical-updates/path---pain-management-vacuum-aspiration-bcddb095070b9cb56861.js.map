Pre-procedure depression or emotional distress is associated with more pain during uterine aspiration (Allen, Kumar, Fitzmaurice, Lifford, &amp; Goldberg, 2006; Belanger, Melzack, &amp; Lauzon, 1989), while prior vaginal deliveries is associated with less (Borgatta &amp; Nickinovich, 1997). Clinicians consistently underestimate the amount of pain women experience during abortion (Singh et al., 2008).</p>\\n<p>Methods of pain management</p>\\n<p>For vacuum aspiration before 13 weeks gestation, a combination of pain medications, paracervical block with local anesthesia, and non-pharmacologic measures typically provides pain relief for most women (World Health Organization, 2014; Renner, Jensen, Nichols, &amp; Edelman, 2010). Intravenous sedation may also be offered.</p>\\n<p>Local anesthesia</p>\\n<p>A paracervical block given before dilating the cervix has been shown to decrease pain with dilation and uterine aspiration (Acmaz, Aksoy, Ozoglu, Aksoy, &amp; Albayrak, 2013; Renner, Nichols, Jensen, Li, &amp; Edelman, 2012; Renner et al., 2016). Paracervical block is a low-risk procedure that can be safely performed by physicians and midlevel providers (Warriner et al., 2006). For further information, see “Pain Management: Paracervical block” on page XXX.</p>\\n<p>Medications</p>\\n<p>Pre-procedure treatment with NSAIDs was found to decrease pain during and after the procedure in studies where women received paracervical block for pain relief (Renner et al., 2010; Romero, Turok, &amp; Gilliam, 2008; Suprapto &amp; Reed, 1984; Wiebe &amp; Rawling, 1995); both oral and intramuscular NSAIDs are effective (Braaten, Hurwitz, Fortin &amp; Goldberg, 2013). Two small studies examining use of oral NSAIDs alone for vacuum aspiration pain found no benefit (Acmaz et al., 2013; Li, Wong, Chan, &amp; Ho, 2003). There are no studies assessing the additional benefit of NSAIDs when moderate sedation is used for pain relief; based on findings from three small randomized trials, it is unclear if NSAIDs provide additional benefit when deeper levels of sedation are used (Khazin et al., 2011; Lowenstein et al., 2006; Roche, Li, James, Fechner, &amp; Tilak, 2012).</p>\\n<p>The benefit of narcotic analgesics in alleviating vacuum aspiration pain is unclear. In one randomized controlled trial, the addition of hydrocodone-acetaminophen to a pain management regimen of paracervical block, ibuprofen and lorazepam did not improve pain during uterine aspiration when compared to placebo (Micks et al., 2012). However, in a different randomized trial, the addition of fentanyl to the same regimen significantly improved procedural pain (Rawling &amp; Weibe, 2001). In women who receive sedation, premedication with narcotic analgesics provides some pain relief, but may be less effective than NSAIDs (Khazin et al., 2011; Lowenstein et al., 2006; Romero et al., 2008).</p>\\n<p>Anxiolytics such as lorazepam or midazolam decrease anxiety related to the procedure and cause amnesia for some women, but do not affect pain (Allen, et al., 2006; Bayer et al., 2015; Wiebe, Podhradsky, &amp; Dijak, 2003).</p>\\n<p>Only one study has assessed effectiveness of pretreatment with paracetamol on pain during uterine aspiration performed without paracervical block, finding no difference between the paracetamol group and control group (Acmaz et al., 2013). In two studies where women also received deep sedation or general anesthesia, paracetamol did not improve post-procedure pain (Cade &amp; Ashley, 1993; Lowenstein et al., 2006).</p>\\n<p>Intravenous sedation</p>\\n<p>Intravenous sedation using a combination of narcotics and anxiolytics is an effective means of pain control and improves satisfaction with the abortion procedure (Allen, Fitzmaurice, Lifford, Lasic, &amp; Goldberg, 2009; Allen, et al., 2006; Wells, 1992; Wong, Ng, Ngai, &amp; Ho, 2002). Intravenous administration of narcotics and anxiolytics is more effective than oral administration for pain during uterine aspiration (Allen et al., 2009). In women who receive sedation for pain management, it is unclear if there is additional benefit in administering a paracervical block (Kan, Ng, &amp; Ho, 2004; Renner et al., 2010; Wong et al., 2002). When delivered by trained staff and with appropriate monitoring, intravenous sedation is safe. A 2017 retrospective cohort study which included more than 20,000 normal weight, overweight and obese women who received intravenous sedation for vacuum aspiration found that the rate of any anesthesia-related adverse event was very low (0.2%) (Horwitz et al., 2018). However, providing intravenous sedation increases the expense, complexity and potential risks of an abortion procedure and requires a trained provider with equipment for patient monitoring. The increased monitoring necessary to deliver intravenous sedation safely requires facility investments in training and equipment.</p>\\n<p>General anesthesia</p>\\n<p>Although effective for pain control, general anesthesia increases the expense, complexity and potential risks associated with abortion and is not recommended for routine procedures (Atrash, Cheek, &amp; Hogue, 1988; Bartlett et al., 2004; Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, 2015). When general anesthesia is used, there is no additional benefit to using a paracervical block (Hall, Ekblom, Persson, &amp; Irestedt, 1997; Renner et al., 2010).</p>\\n<p>Non-pharmacologic pain management</p>\\n<p>Medications and paracervical block should be supplemented with supportive techniques to decrease pain and anxiety. Some measures that may be helpful include respectful staff; a clean, secure and private setting; thorough education about what to expect during the procedure; verbal support; gentle and efficient technique; and application of a heating pad or hot water bottle to the lower abdomen in the recovery room (Akin et al., 2001). A 2016 systematic review of non-pharmacological adjunctive therapies to manage pain included studies of hypnosis, aromatherapy, music, relaxation and imagery exercises and use of doulas. While the review found that no interventions showed a statistically significant reduction in pain or anxiety, women rated non-pharmacological interventions highly and recommend their use, particularly those that include dedicated support people (Tschann, Salcedo, &amp; Kaneshiro, 2016; Wilson, Gurney, Sammel, &amp; Schreiber, 2016).</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<h3><strong>References </strong></h3>\\n<p>Acmaz, G., Aksoy, H., Ozoglu, N., Aksoy, U., &amp; Albayrak, E.

Pre-procedure depression or emotional distress is associated with more pain during uterine aspiration (Allen, Kumar, Fitzmaurice, Lifford, &amp; Goldberg, 2006; Belanger, Melzack, &amp; Lauzon, 1989), while prior vaginal deliveries is associated with less (Borgatta &amp; Nickinovich, 1997). Clinicians consistently underestimate the amount of pain women experience during abortion (Singh et al., 2008).</p>\\n<p>Methods of pain management</p>\\n<p>For vacuum aspiration before 13 weeks gestation, a combination of pain medications, paracervical block with local anesthesia, and non-pharmacologic measures typically provides pain relief for most women (World Health Organization, 2014; Renner, Jensen, Nichols, &amp; Edelman, 2010). Intravenous sedation may also be offered.</p>\\n<p>Local anesthesia</p>\\n<p>A paracervical block given before dilating the cervix has been shown to decrease pain with dilation and uterine aspiration (Acmaz, Aksoy, Ozoglu, Aksoy, &amp; Albayrak, 2013; Renner, Nichols, Jensen, Li, &amp; Edelman, 2012; Renner et al., 2016). Paracervical block is a low-risk procedure that can be safely performed by physicians and midlevel providers (Warriner et al., 2006). For further information, see “Pain Management: Paracervical block” on page XXX.</p>\\n<p>Medications</p>\\n<p>Pre-procedure treatment with NSAIDs was found to decrease pain during and after the procedure in studies where women received paracervical block for pain relief (Renner et al., 2010; Romero, Turok, &amp; Gilliam, 2008; Suprapto &amp; Reed, 1984; Wiebe &amp; Rawling, 1995); both oral and intramuscular NSAIDs are effective (Braaten, Hurwitz, Fortin &amp; Goldberg, 2013). Two small studies examining use of oral NSAIDs alone for vacuum aspiration pain found no benefit (Acmaz et al., 2013; Li, Wong, Chan, &amp; Ho, 2003). There are no studies assessing the additional benefit of NSAIDs when moderate sedation is used for pain relief; based on findings from three small randomized trials, it is unclear if NSAIDs provide additional benefit when deeper levels of sedation are used (Khazin et al., 2011; Lowenstein et al., 2006; Roche, Li, James, Fechner, &amp; Tilak, 2012).</p>\\n<p>The benefit of narcotic analgesics in alleviating vacuum aspiration pain is unclear. In one randomized controlled trial, the addition of hydrocodone-acetaminophen to a pain management regimen of paracervical block, ibuprofen and lorazepam did not improve pain during uterine aspiration when compared to placebo (Micks et al., 2012). However, in a different randomized trial, the addition of fentanyl to the same regimen significantly improved procedural pain (Rawling &amp; Weibe, 2001). In women who receive sedation, premedication with narcotic analgesics provides some pain relief, but may be less effective than NSAIDs (Khazin et al., 2011; Lowenstein et al., 2006; Romero et al., 2008).</p>\\n<p>Anxiolytics such as lorazepam or midazolam decrease anxiety related to the procedure and cause amnesia for some women, but do not affect pain (Allen, et al., 2006; Bayer et al., 2015; Wiebe, Podhradsky, &amp; Dijak, 2003).</p>\\n<p>Only one study has assessed effectiveness of pretreatment with paracetamol on pain during uterine aspiration performed without paracervical block, finding no difference between the paracetamol group and control group (Acmaz et al., 2013). In two studies where women also received deep sedation or general anesthesia, paracetamol did not improve post-procedure pain (Cade &amp; Ashley, 1993; Lowenstein et al., 2006).</p>\\n<p>Intravenous sedation</p>\\n<p>Intravenous sedation using a combination of narcotics and anxiolytics is an effective means of pain control and improves satisfaction with the abortion procedure (Allen, Fitzmaurice, Lifford, Lasic, &amp; Goldberg, 2009; Allen, et al., 2006; Wells, 1992; Wong, Ng, Ngai, &amp; Ho, 2002). Intravenous administration of narcotics and anxiolytics is more effective than oral administration for pain during uterine aspiration (Allen et al., 2009). In women who receive sedation for pain management, it is unclear if there is additional benefit in administering a paracervical block (Kan, Ng, &amp; Ho, 2004; Renner et al., 2010; Wong et al., 2002). When delivered by trained staff and with appropriate monitoring, intravenous sedation is safe. A 2017 retrospective cohort study which included more than 20,000 normal weight, overweight and obese women who received intravenous sedation for vacuum aspiration found that the rate of any anesthesia-related adverse event was very low (0.2%) (Horwitz et al., 2018). However, providing intravenous sedation increases the expense, complexity and potential risks of an abortion procedure and requires a trained provider with equipment for patient monitoring. The increased monitoring necessary to deliver intravenous sedation safely requires facility investments in training and equipment.</p>\\n<p>General anesthesia</p>\\n<p>Although effective for pain control, general anesthesia increases the expense, complexity and potential risks associated with abortion and is not recommended for routine procedures (Atrash, Cheek, &amp; Hogue, 1988; Bartlett et al., 2004; Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, 2015). When general anesthesia is used, there is no additional benefit to using a paracervical block (Hall, Ekblom, Persson, &amp; Irestedt, 1997; Renner et al., 2010).</p>\\n<p>Non-pharmacologic pain management</p>\\n<p>Medications and paracervical block should be supplemented with supportive techniques to decrease pain and anxiety. Some measures that may be helpful include respectful staff; a clean, secure and private setting; thorough education about what to expect during the procedure; verbal support; gentle and efficient technique; and application of a heating pad or hot water bottle to the lower abdomen in the recovery room (Akin et al., 2001). A 2016 systematic review of non-pharmacological adjunctive therapies to manage pain included studies of hypnosis, aromatherapy, music, relaxation and imagery exercises and use of doulas. While the review found that no interventions showed a statistically significant reduction in pain or anxiety, women rated non-pharmacological interventions highly and recommend their use, particularly those that include dedicated support people (Tschann, Salcedo, &amp; Kaneshiro, 2016; Wilson, Gurney, Sammel, &amp; Schreiber, 2016).</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<h3><strong>References </strong></h3>\\n<p>Acmaz, G., Aksoy, H., Ozoglu, N., Aksoy, U., &amp; Albayrak, E.

Intravenous sedation may also be offered.</p>\\n<p>Local anesthesia</p>\\n<p>A paracervical block given before dilating the cervix has been shown to decrease pain with dilation and uterine aspiration (Acmaz, Aksoy, Ozoglu, Aksoy, &amp; Albayrak, 2013; Renner, Nichols, Jensen, Li, &amp; Edelman, 2012; Renner et al., 2016). Paracervical block is a low-risk procedure that can be safely performed by physicians and midlevel providers (Warriner et al., 2006). For further information, see “Pain Management: Paracervical block” on page XXX.</p>\\n<p>Medications</p>\\n<p>Pre-procedure treatment with NSAIDs was found to decrease pain during and after the procedure in studies where women received paracervical block for pain relief (Renner et al., 2010; Romero, Turok, &amp; Gilliam, 2008; Suprapto &amp; Reed, 1984; Wiebe &amp; Rawling, 1995); both oral and intramuscular NSAIDs are effective (Braaten, Hurwitz, Fortin &amp; Goldberg, 2013). Two small studies examining use of oral NSAIDs alone for vacuum aspiration pain found no benefit (Acmaz et al., 2013; Li, Wong, Chan, &amp; Ho, 2003). There are no studies assessing the additional benefit of NSAIDs when moderate sedation is used for pain relief; based on findings from three small randomized trials, it is unclear if NSAIDs provide additional benefit when deeper levels of sedation are used (Khazin et al., 2011; Lowenstein et al., 2006; Roche, Li, James, Fechner, &amp; Tilak, 2012).</p>\\n<p>The benefit of narcotic analgesics in alleviating vacuum aspiration pain is unclear. In one randomized controlled trial, the addition of hydrocodone-acetaminophen to a pain management regimen of paracervical block, ibuprofen and lorazepam did not improve pain during uterine aspiration when compared to placebo (Micks et al., 2012). However, in a different randomized trial, the addition of fentanyl to the same regimen significantly improved procedural pain (Rawling &amp; Weibe, 2001). In women who receive sedation, premedication with narcotic analgesics provides some pain relief, but may be less effective than NSAIDs (Khazin et al., 2011; Lowenstein et al., 2006; Romero et al., 2008).</p>\\n<p>Anxiolytics such as lorazepam or midazolam decrease anxiety related to the procedure and cause amnesia for some women, but do not affect pain (Allen, et al., 2006; Bayer et al., 2015; Wiebe, Podhradsky, &amp; Dijak, 2003).</p>\\n<p>Only one study has assessed effectiveness of pretreatment with paracetamol on pain during uterine aspiration performed without paracervical block, finding no difference between the paracetamol group and control group (Acmaz et al., 2013). In two studies where women also received deep sedation or general anesthesia, paracetamol did not improve post-procedure pain (Cade &amp; Ashley, 1993; Lowenstein et al., 2006).</p>\\n<p>Intravenous sedation</p>\\n<p>Intravenous sedation using a combination of narcotics and anxiolytics is an effective means of pain control and improves satisfaction with the abortion procedure (Allen, Fitzmaurice, Lifford, Lasic, &amp; Goldberg, 2009; Allen, et al., 2006; Wells, 1992; Wong, Ng, Ngai, &amp; Ho, 2002). Intravenous administration of narcotics and anxiolytics is more effective than oral administration for pain during uterine aspiration (Allen et al., 2009). In women who receive sedation for pain management, it is unclear if there is additional benefit in administering a paracervical block (Kan, Ng, &amp; Ho, 2004; Renner et al., 2010; Wong et al., 2002). When delivered by trained staff and with appropriate monitoring, intravenous sedation is safe. A 2017 retrospective cohort study which included more than 20,000 normal weight, overweight and obese women who received intravenous sedation for vacuum aspiration found that the rate of any anesthesia-related adverse event was very low (0.2%) (Horwitz et al., 2018). However, providing intravenous sedation increases the expense, complexity and potential risks of an abortion procedure and requires a trained provider with equipment for patient monitoring. The increased monitoring necessary to deliver intravenous sedation safely requires facility investments in training and equipment.</p>\\n<p>General anesthesia</p>\\n<p>Although effective for pain control, general anesthesia increases the expense, complexity and potential risks associated with abortion and is not recommended for routine procedures (Atrash, Cheek, &amp; Hogue, 1988; Bartlett et al., 2004; Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, 2015). When general anesthesia is used, there is no additional benefit to using a paracervical block (Hall, Ekblom, Persson, &amp; Irestedt, 1997; Renner et al., 2010).</p>\\n<p>Non-pharmacologic pain management</p>\\n<p>Medications and paracervical block should be supplemented with supportive techniques to decrease pain and anxiety. Some measures that may be helpful include respectful staff; a clean, secure and private setting; thorough education about what to expect during the procedure; verbal support; gentle and efficient technique; and application of a heating pad or hot water bottle to the lower abdomen in the recovery room (Akin et al., 2001). A 2016 systematic review of non-pharmacological adjunctive therapies to manage pain included studies of hypnosis, aromatherapy, music, relaxation and imagery exercises and use of doulas. While the review found that no interventions showed a statistically significant reduction in pain or anxiety, women rated non-pharmacological interventions highly and recommend their use, particularly those that include dedicated support people (Tschann, Salcedo, &amp; Kaneshiro, 2016; Wilson, Gurney, Sammel, &amp; Schreiber, 2016).</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<h3><strong>References </strong></h3>\\n<p>Acmaz, G., Aksoy, H., Ozoglu, N., Aksoy, U., &amp; Albayrak, E.
