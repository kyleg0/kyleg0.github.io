In the largest multicenter randomized controlled trial, which included 4,972 women given either misoprostol 400mcg vaginally or placebo three hours before a vacuum aspiration, there was no difference in the rates of cervical laceration, perforation or infection between the two groups (Meirik, Huong, Piaggio, Bergel, &amp; von Hertzen, 2012).  However, a significant decrease in the risk of incomplete abortion was observed in those who received misoprostol for cervical preparation (&lt;1%) compared to the placebo group (2%), but side effects were more frequent for women who were given misoprostol. For women at higher risk of complications during cervical dilation (young women, women with cervical abnormalities or prior cervical surgery) or for inexperienced providers, there may be a benefit from cervical preparation before 12-14 weeks gestation (Allen &amp; Goldberg, 2016; Grimes, Schulz, &amp; Cates, 1984; Kaunitz, Rovira, Grimes, &amp; Schulz, 1985).</p>\\n<p>Side effects of cervical preparation</p>\\n<p>In the largest randomized controlled trial of misoprostol for cervical preparation, 55% of women who took misoprostol complained of pre-procedure abdominal pain and 37% had vaginal bleeding, compared to 22% and 7% in the placebo group (Meirik et al., 2012). In addition, cervical preparation adds cost, complexity and time to an abortion, as women must visit the clinic a day before the procedure to have osmotic dilators placed or to receive mifepristone, or wait in the health center for misoprostol to take effect. Because abortion before 13 weeks gestation is very safe, the gestational age at which the benefit of cervical preparation outweighs the side-effects is not known (Kapp et al., 2010). Women’s satisfaction with cervical preparation has not been systematically studied in randomized controlled trials but is an important consideration for quality of care and service delivery (Kapp et al., 2010).</p>\\n<p>Choice of methods</p>\\n<p>The choice of misoprostol, mifepristone or osmotic dilators for cervical preparation depends on availability, expense, convenience and preference. Sublingual misoprostol has superior effectiveness but more gastrointestinal side effects than vaginal misoprostol (Kapp et al., 2010; Saav, Kopp Kallner, Fiala, &amp; Gemzell-Danielsson, 2015; Saxena, Sarda, Salhan, &amp; Nanda, 2008). Mifepristone given 24 hours prior to the abortion is superior to misoprostol but adds time and expense to the abortion procedure (Ashok, Flett, &amp; Templeton, 2000; Kapp et al., 2010). Misoprostol and osmotic dilators have similar effectiveness but dilator placement is associated with increased pain, increased time to procedure and reduced satisfaction for women (Bartz, et al., 2013; Burnett, Corbett, &amp; Gertenstein, 2005; MacIsaac, Grossman, Balistreri, &amp; Darney, 1999).</p>\\n<p><em>Young women</em></p>\\n<p>Adolescents may benefit from cervical preparation due to their increased risk of cervical injury during abortion (Allen &amp; Goldberg, 2016; Schulz et al., 1983). This risk is independent of nulliparity (Meirik et al., 2014); adolescents have physiologically immature cervices that may be more difficult to dilate regardless of obstetric history (Allen &amp; Goldberg, 2016; Schulz et al., 1983).

In the largest multicenter randomized controlled trial, which included 4,972 women given either misoprostol 400mcg vaginally or placebo three hours before a vacuum aspiration, there was no difference in the rates of cervical laceration, perforation or infection between the two groups (Meirik, Huong, Piaggio, Bergel, &amp; von Hertzen, 2012).  However, a significant decrease in the risk of incomplete abortion was observed in those who received misoprostol for cervical preparation (&lt;1%) compared to the placebo group (2%), but side effects were more frequent for women who were given misoprostol. For women at higher risk of complications during cervical dilation (young women, women with cervical abnormalities or prior cervical surgery) or for inexperienced providers, there may be a benefit from cervical preparation before 12-14 weeks gestation (Allen &amp; Goldberg, 2016; Grimes, Schulz, &amp; Cates, 1984; Kaunitz, Rovira, Grimes, &amp; Schulz, 1985).</p>\\n<p>Side effects of cervical preparation</p>\\n<p>In the largest randomized controlled trial of misoprostol for cervical preparation, 55% of women who took misoprostol complained of pre-procedure abdominal pain and 37% had vaginal bleeding, compared to 22% and 7% in the placebo group (Meirik et al., 2012). In addition, cervical preparation adds cost, complexity and time to an abortion, as women must visit the clinic a day before the procedure to have osmotic dilators placed or to receive mifepristone, or wait in the health center for misoprostol to take effect. Because abortion before 13 weeks gestation is very safe, the gestational age at which the benefit of cervical preparation outweighs the side-effects is not known (Kapp et al., 2010). Women’s satisfaction with cervical preparation has not been systematically studied in randomized controlled trials but is an important consideration for quality of care and service delivery (Kapp et al., 2010).</p>\\n<p>Choice of methods</p>\\n<p>The choice of misoprostol, mifepristone or osmotic dilators for cervical preparation depends on availability, expense, convenience and preference. Sublingual misoprostol has superior effectiveness but more gastrointestinal side effects than vaginal misoprostol (Kapp et al., 2010; Saav, Kopp Kallner, Fiala, &amp; Gemzell-Danielsson, 2015; Saxena, Sarda, Salhan, &amp; Nanda, 2008). Mifepristone given 24 hours prior to the abortion is superior to misoprostol but adds time and expense to the abortion procedure (Ashok, Flett, &amp; Templeton, 2000; Kapp et al., 2010). Misoprostol and osmotic dilators have similar effectiveness but dilator placement is associated with increased pain, increased time to procedure and reduced satisfaction for women (Bartz, et al., 2013; Burnett, Corbett, &amp; Gertenstein, 2005; MacIsaac, Grossman, Balistreri, &amp; Darney, 1999).</p>\\n<p><em>Young women</em></p>\\n<p>Adolescents may benefit from cervical preparation due to their increased risk of cervical injury during abortion (Allen &amp; Goldberg, 2016; Schulz et al., 1983). This risk is independent of nulliparity (Meirik et al., 2014); adolescents have physiologically immature cervices that may be more difficult to dilate regardless of obstetric history (Allen &amp; Goldberg, 2016; Schulz et al., 1983). There are no clinical trials examining the use of cervical preparation in this patient population.</p>\\n<h3>References</h3>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Allen, R., &amp; Goldberg, A. (2016).
