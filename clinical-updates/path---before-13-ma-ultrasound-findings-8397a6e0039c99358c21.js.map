In a pooled analysis of 2,208 women one week after medical abortion, after women with a persistent gestational sac were excluded, the average endometrial thickness was 10.9mm in women who did not require more intervention and 14.5mm in 30 women who did require intervention (Reeves, Fox, Lohr, &amp; Creinin, 2009). Although the average endometrial thickness in women who require intervention tends to be higher, because of the range and overlap between successful and unsuccessful abortion, no study has found that there is a thickness above which a diagnosis of unsuccessful medical abortion can be made. The decision to intervene should be made on clinical signs and symptoms, such as ongoing or heavy bleeding, rather than on ultrasound findings.</p>\\n<p><em>Persistent gestational sac:</em> A persistent gestational sac, in which the sac is present but there is no viable embryonic tissue, occurs in less than 1% of medical abortions with the recommended mifepristone and misoprostol regimen (Creinin et al., 2004; Creinin et al., 2007; Winikoff et al., 2008). A persistent gestational sac is not a viable pregnancy and may be managed with aspiration, a second dose of misoprostol or expectant management according to a woman’s preference. In a study of women with a persistent gestational sac within 11 days of medical abortion, a second dose of misoprostol was found to lead to expulsion of a nonviable sac in 69% of women (Reeves, Kudva, &amp; Creinin, 2008).</p>\\n<p>INSERT IMAGE HERE</p>\\n<p>CAPTION: <em>Persistent gestational sac</em></p>\\n<p>PHOTO CREDIT: <em>Courtesy of Mary Fjerstad</em></p>\\n<p><em>Ongoing viable pregnancy:</em> An ongoing pregnancy, in which a growing sac and/or embryo with cardiac activity are present, occurs in less than 1% of medical abortions with the recommended mifepristone and misoprostol regimen (Von Hertzen et al., 2009; Winikoff et al., 2008). Some women will be able to identify this outcome without ultrasound due to lack of bleeding or continued pregnancy symptoms. A woman with an ongoing pregnancy should be offered uterine evacuation as soon as possible with either vacuum aspiration or a second dose of misoprostol, depending on gestational age and local context. The success rate of misoprostol after failed medical abortion is 36% (Reeves et al., 2008; WHO, 2014). If a woman chooses a second dose of misoprostol, she must be followed to see if it is successful.</p>\\n<h3>References</h3>\\n<p>Cowett, A. A., Cohen, L. S., Lichtenberg, E. S., &amp; Stika, C. S.

In a pooled analysis of 2,208 women one week after medical abortion, after women with a persistent gestational sac were excluded, the average endometrial thickness was 10.9mm in women who did not require more intervention and 14.5mm in 30 women who did require intervention (Reeves, Fox, Lohr, &amp; Creinin, 2009). Although the average endometrial thickness in women who require intervention tends to be higher, because of the range and overlap between successful and unsuccessful abortion, no study has found that there is a thickness above which a diagnosis of unsuccessful medical abortion can be made. The decision to intervene should be made on clinical signs and symptoms, such as ongoing or heavy bleeding, rather than on ultrasound findings.</p>\\n<p><em>Persistent gestational sac:</em> A persistent gestational sac, in which the sac is present but there is no viable embryonic tissue, occurs in less than 1% of medical abortions with the recommended mifepristone and misoprostol regimen (Creinin et al., 2004; Creinin et al., 2007; Winikoff et al., 2008). A persistent gestational sac is not a viable pregnancy and may be managed with aspiration, a second dose of misoprostol or expectant management according to a woman’s preference. In a study of women with a persistent gestational sac within 11 days of medical abortion, a second dose of misoprostol was found to lead to expulsion of a nonviable sac in 69% of women (Reeves, Kudva, &amp; Creinin, 2008).</p>\\n<p>INSERT IMAGE HERE</p>\\n<p>CAPTION: <em>Persistent gestational sac</em></p>\\n<p>PHOTO CREDIT: <em>Courtesy of Mary Fjerstad</em></p>\\n<p><em>Ongoing viable pregnancy:</em> An ongoing pregnancy, in which a growing sac and/or embryo with cardiac activity are present, occurs in less than 1% of medical abortions with the recommended mifepristone and misoprostol regimen (Von Hertzen et al., 2009; Winikoff et al., 2008). Some women will be able to identify this outcome without ultrasound due to lack of bleeding or continued pregnancy symptoms. A woman with an ongoing pregnancy should be offered uterine evacuation as soon as possible with either vacuum aspiration or a second dose of misoprostol, depending on gestational age and local context. The success rate of misoprostol after failed medical abortion is 36% (Reeves et al., 2008; WHO, 2014). If a woman chooses a second dose of misoprostol, she must be followed to see if it is successful.</p>\\n<h3>References</h3>\\n<p>Cowett, A. A., Cohen, L. S., Lichtenberg, E. S., &amp; Stika, C. S.
