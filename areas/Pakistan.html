        <p>Each year, thousands of Pakistani women suffer, and sometimes die, from the consequences of unsafe abortion. Current evidence
        shows that the average Pakistani woman will have one abortion in her lifetime. Abortion is legal in Pakistan to save the
        woman’s life or to provide “necessary treatment,” however, it is highly stigmatized and safe abortion and postabortion care
        services are often inaccessible.</p>

        <p>Since 2007, Ipas has worked to decrease death and injury from unsafe abortion in Pakistan through socially and culturally
        sensitive interventions, including training health-care providers and working closely with government and nongovernmental
        organizations to improve the quality and availability of postabortion care in both the public and private sectors.</p>
