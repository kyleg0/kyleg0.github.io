        <h2 class="no-margin">Malawi</h2>
        <p>Malawi’s punitive abortion law, based on a colonial law dating back to 1861, puts women, girls and service providers at risk
        of arrest, prosecution and jail terms. The only legal exception is for abortion performed to save a woman’s life. These dangerous
        and restrictive conditions contribute to the country’s high rate of unsafe abortion. At least 700,000 women in Malawi have
        unsafe abortions each year because they have no other option, and an estimated 18,700 have complications requiring medical
        attention.</p>

        <p>Working with the government and other partners, Ipas Malawi is involved in efforts to address the problem of unsafe abortion
        and improve public-sector delivery of treatment for abortion-related complications. Together with partners in the Coalition
        for Prevention of Unsafe Abortion (COPUA)—which includes community-based organizations, youth-focused NGOs, policymakers,
        traditional leaders and others—Ipas Malawi also is working to build support for abortion law reform.</p>
