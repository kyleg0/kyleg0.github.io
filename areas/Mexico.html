        <p>Abortion is legal during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy in Mexico’s Federal District (which includes Mexico City), and women
        and girls living there have the right to safe, legal abortion free of charge during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy through
        the public health system. But in all other states in Mexico, abortion is legally restricted.</p>

        <p>Ipas Mexico works closely with partners to improve reproductive health care throughout the country. Programs include work
        to strengthen health systems by training safe abortion providers and clinic staff, as well as by supporting health centers’
        efforts to ensure high-quality abortion care. Ipas Mexico also advocates for laws and policies that advance women’s right
        to abortion, conducts community education to reduce abortion stigma, trains young advocates for sexual and reproductive rights,
        and collaborates on multimedia campaigns in Mexico City to inform women and girls on how to access safe abortion.</p>
