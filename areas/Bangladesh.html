        <p>Abortion is only legal in Bangladesh to save a woman’s life. But "menstrual regulation"—which involves vacuum aspiration
        to bring on menstruation and thereby establish non-pregnancy—is legal in the first trimester. Despite this legal service,
        unsafe abortion does occur, particularly in rural parts of the country.</p>

        <p>In 2011, Ipas established a program in Bangladesh to reduce maternal deaths and injuries related to unsafe abortion by strengthening
        postabortion care and menstrual regulation services. Ipas Bangladesh also advocates for policy changes that will expand women’s
        access to services.</p>
