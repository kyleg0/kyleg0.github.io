        <p>In Kenya, unsafe abortion has long been recognized as a leading cause of death and injury for women. Under the new
            Kenyan constitution, abortion is legal under certain circumstances, but many providers have still not been trained
            in safe abortion care, and women continue to seek unsafe procedures and suffer complications. In neighboring
            Uganda, abortion-related causes account for 26 percent of maternal deaths, and most women who have abortions
            undergo unsafe procedures.</p>

        <p>Ipas Africa Alliance for Women’s Reproductive Health and Rights works in Kenya and Uganda—and with regional East
            Africa partners—to reduce deaths from unsafe abortion, to expand the availability of safe abortion care, and
            to improve the legal and policy environment for safe abortion across the continent. Based in Nairobi, Kenya,
            Ipas Africa Alliance has programs to train safe abortion providers, support health clinics that offer abortion
            services, and develop youth champions for sexual and reproductive rights. In Uganda, programs also support comprehensive
            sexuality education that includes safe abortion, and Ipas Africa Alliance has worked with Uganda’s Ministry of
            Health Reproductive Division and a team of other partners to develop national standards and guidelines for reducing
            death and injury from unsafe abortion.</p>
