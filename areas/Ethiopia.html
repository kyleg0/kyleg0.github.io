        <p>After liberalizing Ethiopia’s abortion law in 2005, the government implemented programs to train health-care providers, equip
        facilities and expand the services they offer, and integrate abortion care into broader reproductive health services. These
        efforts have resulted in significant improvements in women’s ability to access safe abortion. However, many abortions continue
        to occur outside health facilities, often under unsafe conditions.</p>

        <p>Working closely with the Ministry of Health and other partners, Ipas Ethiopia has become a regional leader in establishing
        safe abortion services and creating reproductive health networks that connect women with care. Programs include training
        safe abortion providers and supporting health clinics with necessary supplies, supporting university students who serve as
        peer educators on sexual and reproductive health, and working to educate communities on how and where to access contraception
        and safe abortion.</p>
