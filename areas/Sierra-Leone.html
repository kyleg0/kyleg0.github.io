        <h2 class="no-margin">Sierra Leone</h2>
        <p>Despite improvements in the last several years, Sierra Leone’s maternal mortality ratio is one of the worst in the world—and
        unsafe abortion causes 30 percent of maternal deaths. The country’s highly restrictive abortion law, combined with high rates
        of sexual violence and unwanted pregnancy affecting women and girls, drives many to seek unsafe abortions. There is a great
        unmet need for reproductive health information, family planning, safe abortion and treatment for complications of unsafe
        abortion (postabortion care).</p>

        <p>Ipas Sierra Leone works with the Ministry of Health and Sanitation and other key government and nongovernmental actors to
        improve women’s reproductive health care. In 2011, the Ministry of Health and Sanitation partnered with Ipas on studies that
        revealed unwanted pregnancy and unsafe abortion are significant problems in all regions of the country. In 2015, Sierra Leone’s
        parliament voted to make abortion legal, but due to pressure from opposition actors, the president refused to sign the bill
        into law and it died. Ipas continues to work with partners to advocate for law change that would save women’s lives and protect
        their reproductive rights.</p>
