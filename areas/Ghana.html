        <p>Ghana’s abortion law is one of Africa’s most progressive. However, despite liberalization of the law, women’s access to abortion
        services remains limited and unsafe abortion continues to be a leading cause of maternal mortality in Ghana.</p>

        <p>Ipas Ghana is a key voice in a national coalition of government stakeholders and nonprofit organizations united to reduce
        maternal deaths and injuries. Founded in 2006 and based in Accra, Ipas Ghana advocates for women’s access to a full range
        of reproductive health services, including family planning and safe abortion.</p>
