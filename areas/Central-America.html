        <p>In 2006, Nicaragua’s government enacted a total abortion ban, endangering the lives of women and girls and forcing those
        with unwanted pregnancies to carry them to term against their will, or else seek clandestine and often unsafe abortions.
        As a 2016 study by Ipas Central America found, the abortion ban is not the only problem: Systemic failings in the health
        and legal sectors also create a culture of impunity for sexual violence perpetrators and a lack of sufficient treatment and
        justice for victims—all further denying women and girls their human rights. Elsewhere in Central America, women with unwanted
        pregnancies don’t fare much better. El Salvador and Honduras also ban abortion completely, and Guatemala only permits abortion
        to save a woman’s life.</p>

        <p>Ipas Central America has been working with partners across the region since the late 1980s to make safe, high-quality sexual
        and reproductive health care available for the women and girls who need it. Based in Managua, Nicaragua, Ipas Central America
        also works to position abortion as a human rights issue and show how restrictive abortion laws violate international treaties
        ratified by Central American countries. By incorporating a human rights perspective in university curricula, Ipas Central
        America and key partners aim to catalyze the formation of a new generation of health-care providers who are respectful guarantors
        and advocates of individuals’ right to high-quality sexual and reproductive health care. Since Nicaragua’s abortion ban was
        enacted in 2006, Ipas Central America has worked with partners to build a movement in support of repealing the ban. Similarly,
        Ipas Central America collaborates with partners in El Salvador to support the growing movement for legal abortion there.</p>
