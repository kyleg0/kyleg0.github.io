        <p>Unsafe abortion is the third leading cause of maternal mortality in Myanmar, where abortion is legal only to save the life
        of the woman. Many women arrive in the public health system seeking care for complications from unsafe abortions.</p>

        <p>Ipas Myanmar is working in partnership with the national Department of Health to introduce high-quality postabortion care
        in public facilities, including provision of training and support to providers. Ipas Myanmar also works with partner NGOs
        in Myanmar to raise public awareness about the dangers of unsafe abortion and how to obtain safe and comprehensive contraceptive
        and postabortion care.</p>
