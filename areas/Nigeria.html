        <p>Unsafe abortion is one of the most significant and preventable causes of maternal death and injury in Nigeria, which has
        one of the world’s highest maternal mortality rates. Abortion is illegal except to save the life of the woman, and procedures
        are often inaccessible even for women who meet this requirement, forcing women to seek out clandestine and unsafe procedures.
        In addition, millions of people have been displaced within Nigeria since 2012 due to the Boko Haram insurgency, resulting
        in a humanitarian crisis in which women and girls are at even higher risk for sexual violence and unwanted pregnancy—and
        have little to no access to reproductive health care.</p>

        <p>Ipas Nigeria works to increase women’s access to vital reproductive health and family planning services and to ensure that
        high-quality treatment for complications of unsafe abortion (postabortion care) is available. Ipas Nigeria also works with
        alliances and partners to advocate for laws and policies that address sexual violence, and to develop youth champions for
        safe, legal abortion.</p>
