        <p>In 2014, Mozambique liberalized its abortion law with the goal of reducing maternal mortality by greatly broadening women’s
        access to safe abortion care. Women in Mozambique can now get a legal abortion upon request during the first 12 weeks of
        pregnancy, and later in cases of rape, incest and fetal anomaly. However, after so many years of a restrictive abortion law
        that forced many women to terminate unwanted pregnancies with clandestine and unsafe procedures, the reality of unsafe abortion
        persists in Mozambique today and is one of the leading causes of maternal mortality.</p>

        <p>Prior to the 2014 law change, Ipas worked with the Ministry of Health and other partners in Mozambique to improve training
        and service delivery related to treatment for complications of unsafe abortion (postabortion care) and to conduct an assessment
        of abortion and postabortion services in public facilities across the country. Today, Ipas is continuing its partnership
        with the government and other NGOs in Mozambique to increase the health system’s capacity to make high-quality abortion care
        and contraceptive services available and accessible throughout the nation.</p>
