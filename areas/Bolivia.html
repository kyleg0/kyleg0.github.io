        <h2 class="no-margin">Bolivia</h2>
        <p>Bolivia prohibits abortion except in cases of rape, incest or when the woman’s life or health is endangered, forcing many
        women and girls to seek clandestine and often unsafe procedures. Professionals who could facilitate women’s access to safe
        abortion when the legal requirements are met often do not have training on the law and end up creating barriers for women.
        As a result, unsafe abortion persists as the country’s third leading cause of maternal death.</p>

        <p>Ipas Bolivia works both to improve women’s access to reproductive health care and safe abortion, and to reduce sexual violence.
        Programs include training safe abortion providers, as well as partnering with Bolivia’s Ministry of Justice to train law
        enforcement, judicial and policy professionals on the legal provisions for abortion and guidelines for handling cases in
        which women seek abortion care. In addition, Ipas Bolivia collaborates with partners to train police and health workers on
        how to properly handle sexual violence cases—and to ensure that women themselves know the legal grounds for accessing abortion
        care. Programs also work to build youth champions for sexual and reproductive rights.</p>
