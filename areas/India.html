        <p>India has one of Asia’s broadest abortion laws. Abortions may be performed by a registered physician in a government-approved
        hospital or facility during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. However, in this sprawling country of more than one billion
        people, progressive laws do not guarantee access to safe abortion services. Unsafe abortions still far outnumber legal procedures;
        an estimated 60 percent of abortions performed in India are unsafe.</p>

        <p>Ipas works in India in partnership with the Ipas Development Foundation (IDF), operating a program that covers 14 states.
        Starting with training providers and promoting safe abortion technologies at the state and district levels, Ipas and IDF
        now work to implement the abortion law; advocate for increased commitment to women’s access to safe services; forge partnerships;
        and strengthen the public health system at all levels to create high-quality, comprehensive abortion care services.</p>
