        <h2 class="no-margin">Indonesia</h2>
        <p>Indonesia has a great unmet need for sexual and reproductive health services and information, and unsafe abortion is believed
        to cause approximately 30 percent of maternal deaths in the country. Abortion is only legal under limited circumstances (rape
        and in cases of risk to a woman’s life or health), causing many women to resort to seeking unsafe abortions.</p>

        <p>Ipas Indonesia is working to develop a close partnership with the Ministry of Health to increase the health system’s ability
        to provide high-quality postabortion and contraceptive care—and to ensure women and adolescents can access these services
        as needed. Ipas works with partners to advance laws and policies that fulfill women’s and girls’ sexual and reproductive
        rights and to reduce the devastating impact of unsafe abortion on the lives of Indonesian women and adolescents.</p>
