        <h2 class="no-margin">Donating to Ipas</h2>
       	<p>Ipas is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. All contributions to Ipas are tax deductible to the full extent allowed by law. Ipas will not trade, share or sell a donor's personal information with anyone else, nor send donor mailings on behalf of other organizations. All information concerning donors or prospective donors is kept strictly confidential by Ipas and its staff unless permission is obtained from the donor to release such information, or unless disclosure is required by due legal process.</p>
    
        <p>For online donations, Ipas has entered into a contract with Authorize.net to provide a secure online connection to allow you to transmit credit card information for your online donation. Authorize.net will be responsible for the security of the financial information (such as credit card information) that you provide. Please review Authorize.net's privacy policy for additional information concerning the privacy of your information and the security measures Authorize.net employs.</p>
    
        <p>After you make your online donation, Authorize.net then provides information about you and your donation to us.

We use this information to acknowledge your gift, and to keep records regarding our donors for administrative and tax purposes.</p>
    
        <p>Ipas recognizes that the operation of the organization requires the maintenance and management of extensive donor and prospect records. Donor records often contain sensitive information that has been shared with or developed by Ipas staff on a confidential basis. "Records" means all files, including electronic data, containing information on donors or prospective donors to Ipas. The use of donor information is limited to internal purposes, by authorized individuals, to better service existing donors, potential donors or partner relationships. We make every effort to ensure the security of this information.

        <p>We may publish lists of Ipas's donors in various donor publications, but not online. We may include the names of donors unless you indicate that you prefer to remain anonymous.</p>
    
        <p>If you indicate that your company has a matching gift program and provide the required form, we will use that information to process the matching gift from your company, to update our donor list, to acknowledge the company, and to include the company's name on published lists of Ipas's donors (unless we are notified that the company would prefer to remain anonymous). We will not initiate any further contact with the company unless you or the company requests that we do so.</p>
